Use your own conditions from step 1 as the author's conditions, with these ids:
- r1: Record is a Box task (not a comment, file version, or other object type).
- r2: The task's creator (created_by) is pat.kim@northwind.example.
- r3: The task's creation date falls on September 14 (year unspecified).
- r4: The task's description/message asks to check the indemnity clause.
- r5: (Action) The task's due date should be updated to October 20, 2026.

The candidate records are the rows of `box_tasks`: 8301, 8302, 8303, 8304, 8305.
For every candidate, give the ids of the author's conditions it fails under the careful reading (an empty list if it meets all of them), whether a careful colleague could still argue that it meets the request (contestable), and a short note. Then say whether the author's conditions faithfully capture the request as you read it in step 1 (and what differs). For each ambiguity you listed, say whether a careful reader would genuinely be unsure which reading was meant, and whether the readings select different candidates. Finally, say whether the request reads like something a real user would write, without hints that only a test would contain.
