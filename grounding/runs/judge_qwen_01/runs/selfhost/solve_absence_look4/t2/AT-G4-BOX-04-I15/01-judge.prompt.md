# Trial of test `AT-G4-BOX-04-I15` (box)

Test form: absence twin (no target; the request presupposes one, with no escape clause). Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Add the tag q3-signoff to the PDF in the Budget Reviews folder with the review task Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen that she approved.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `box_files`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `8106` (fact `B:TaskAssignment.task_id`, family F5): Maya Chen's assignment is still incomplete; the approved assignment on that task belongs to Omar Haddad.

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 5.

#### Step 2
Reasoning: I need to find the Budget Reviews folder and locate the PDF. The task Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen should have been a "review" action, and Maya Chen approved it. Let's search for the folder first.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/search?type=folder&query=Budget%20Reviews"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"id\":\"8100\",\"type\":\"folder\",\"name\":\"Budget Reviews\",\"parent\":{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"size\":0,\"trashed_at\":null,\"modified_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"path_collection\":{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"}]},\"modified_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"item_status\":\"active\",\"content_created_at\":null,\"content_modified_at\":null,\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"description\":\"\",\"folder_upload_email\":null,\"owned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"purged_at\":null,\"shared_link\":null}],\"limit\":30,\"offset\":0,\"type\":\"search_results_items\"}"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: Found the folder "Budget Reviews" with ID 8100. Next, I'll retrieve the items inside it.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/8100/items?limit=100"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8106\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98106\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Q3 budget appendix.pdf\"}],\"offset\":0,\"limit\":100,\"order\":[{\"by\":\"type\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"},{\"by\":\"name\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"}]}"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: There's only one PDF in the Budget Reviews folder: "Q3 budget appendix.pdf", file ID 8106. Next, I need to verify the task: a review task that Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen, which Maya Chen approved. Let me check the file's tasks and comments.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8106/tasks" ; echo "-----" ; curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8106/comments"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task\",\"id\":\"9106\",\"message\":\"Please review the Q3 budget figures\",\"action\":\"review\",\"is_completed\":false,\"completion_rule\":\"all_assignees\",\"due_at\":null,\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8106\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98106\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Q3 budget appendix.pdf\"},\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000006\",\"name\":\"Priya Nair\",\"login\":\"priya.nair@northwind.example\"},\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"task_assignment_collection\":{\"total_count\":2,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task_assignment\",\"id\":\"9206\",\"message\":null,\"resolution_state\":\"incomplete\",\"assigned_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"reminded_at\":null,\"completed_at\":null,\"assigned_to\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000002\",\"name\":\"Maya Chen\",\"login\":\"maya.chen@northwind.example\"},\"assigned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000004\",\"name\":\"Leo Park\",\"login\":\"leo.park@northwind.example\"},\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8106\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98106\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Q3 budget appendix.pdf\"}},{\"type\":\"task_assignment\",\"id\":\"9207\",\"message\":null,\"resolution_state\":\"approved\",\"assigned_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"reminded_at\":null,\"completed_at\":null,\"assigned_to\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000007\",\"name\":\"Omar Haddad\",\"login\":\"omar.haddad@northwind.example\"},\"assigned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000004\",\"name\":\"Leo Park\",\"login\":\"leo.park@northwind.example\"},\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8106\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98106\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Q3 budget appendix.pdf\"}}]}}]}-----\n{\"total_count\":0,\"entries\":[],\"offset\":0,\"limit\":100}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: I need to find a task that matches the following conditions:
1. It's a review task
2. Assigned by Leo Park to Maya Chen
3. Approved by Maya Chen

Looking at the task collection for file 8106:
- Task 9106: "Please review Q3 budget figures", action: review, created by Priya Nair
  - Task assignment 9206: assigned_to Maya Chen, assigned_by Leo Park, resolution_state: **incomplete**
  - Task assignment 9207: assigned_to Omar Haddad, assigned_by Leo Park, resolution_state: **approved**

So the task assigned by Leo Park to Maya Chen has a resolution_state of "incomplete", not "approved". The task assigned to Omar Haddad is the one with "approved".

The user's description: "The review task that Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen, and that Maya Chen approved".

The task Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen (9206) is "incomplete" — Maya Chen has not approved it. The task assigned to Omar Haddad (9207) is "approved".

Therefore, there is no task matching the description: a task that Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen AND that Maya Chen approved. There's only one file in the Budget Reviews folder, and there's only one task on it. Let me double-check:
- Task 9106 was created by Priya Nair, but the assignments were made by Leo Park to Maya Chen (incomplete) and to Omar Haddad (approved).

So the condition "assigned by Leo Park to Maya Chen" matches assignment 9206, but its state is incomplete, not approved. The approved one (9207) was assigned to Omar Haddad, not Maya Chen.

This looks like a deliberat
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
I found the folder and the file, but there's a mismatch I need to flag before tagging:

**Budget Reviews** (folder 8106's parent 8100) contains one PDF: **Q3 budget appendix.pdf** (file 8106). It has one review task — "Please review the Q3 budget figures" (task 9106) — with two assignments, both made by **Leo Park**:

| Assigned to | Resolution state |
|---|---|
| **Maya Chen** | **incomplete** (not approved) |
| **Omar Haddad** | approved |

So the task Leo Park assigned to **Maya Chen has not been approved** — it's still incomplete. The only *approved* assignment on that file is **Omar Haddad's**, not Maya's.

There's no task matching your full description (assigned by Leo Park to Maya Chen **and** approved by Maya Chen). Before I tag anything:

1. Tag the PDF anyway (the file is unambiguous — it's the only PDF in Budget Reviews)?
2. Or did you mean the task Leo Park assigned to **Omar Haddad** (the approved one)?
3. Or was I supposed to look elsewhere — e.g., a different file or a different approver?

My default if you just say "go ahead" would be option 1, since the file itself is unambiguous.
