# Trial of test `FP-AP2-CAL-01-I12-I13-I14` (calendar)

Test form: fact probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Rename the 'Product Team' calendar that I currently have checked to 'Eng Product Sync'. If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `calendars`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `c_1604bc630329a235f8a80a0dbc@group.calendar.google.com` (fact `A:Calendar.summary`, family F8): It is checked, but its name is 'Product Team Offsite', not 'Product Team'.
  record: {"id": "c_1604bc630329a235f8a80a0dbc@group.calendar.google.com", "summary": "Product Team Offsite", "time_zone": "America/Los_Angeles", "owner_id": "d0ea98ff74d72e74922a3c36", "data_owner": "maya.chen@northwind.example", "deleted": false, "created_at": "2018-01-01T00:00:00", "updated_at": "2018-01-01T00:00:00"}
- DECOY `c_58411f94b78fa7f080ccd72d3c@group.calendar.google.com` (fact `A:Calendar.summary`, family F0): It is checked, but it is an unrelated calendar named 'Engineering Roadmap'.
  record: {"id": "c_58411f94b78fa7f080ccd72d3c@group.calendar.google.com", "summary": "Engineering Roadmap", "time_zone": "America/Los_Angeles", "owner_id": "f7dbc98da5ab11e78c7f091a", "data_owner": "sam.rivera@northwind.example", "deleted": false, "created_at": "2018-01-01T00:00:00", "updated_at": "2018-01-01T00:00:00"}
- DECOY `jordan.lee@northwind.example` (fact `A:Calendar.summary`, family F0): Jordan Lee's own primary calendar is always checked, but its name is the account email, not 'Product Team'.
  record: {"id": "jordan.lee@northwind.example", "summary": "jordan.lee@northwind.example", "description": "Primary calendar", "time_zone": "America/Los_Angeles", "owner_id": "u_actor", "data_owner": "jordan.lee@northwind.example", "deleted": false, "created_at": "2018-01-01T00:00:00", "updated_at": "2018-01-01T00:00:00"}

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 3.

#### Step 1
Reasoning: The user wants to rename the Google Calendar "Product Team" to "Eng Product Sync". I should read the SKILL.md for the google-calendar skill first.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/b185ef5b12fe4b73/workspace-assistant/skills/google-calendar/SKILL.md"}
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "---\nname: google-calendar\ndescription: \"Google Calendar scheduling and events API. Use it for anything in the user's Google Calendar account.\"\nmetadata: {\"openclaw\": {\"requires\": {\"bins\": [\"curl\"]}}}\n---\n\n# Google Calendar\n\n## Current Session\n- **Service**: Google Calendar\n- **Base URL**: https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3\n- **Description**: Google Calendar scheduling and events API\n\n## Environment\n- You are authenticated as a user in the Google Calendar workspace/account.\n- Authentication is handled automatically via proxy.

#### Step 2
Reasoning: The user wants to rename the "Product Team" calendar that's currently checked. "Currently checked" — in the Google Calendar API, the calendar list entry has an `accessRole` (owner, writer, reader, freeBusyReader), and also a `hidden` field, but there's no direct "checked" field... Actually, in the Google Calendar web UI, the "checked" calendars are the ones displayed. In the API, the `hidden` field in calendarList controls visibility. But "currently checked" might mean the calendar is visible (hidden=false).

Let me first fetch the calendar list and look for a calendar named "Product Team".
Command: curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"kind\":\"calendar#calendarList\",\"items\":[{\"kind\":\"calendar#calendarListEntry\",\"etag\":\"\\\"c9fe9417eafd392d\\\"\",\"id\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\",\"accessRole\":\"owner\",\"summary\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\",\"description\":\"Primary calendar\",\"timeZone\":\"America/Los_Angeles\",\"conferenceProperties\":{\"allowedConferenceSolutionTypes\":[\"hangoutsMeet\"]},\"dataOwner\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#9fc6e7\",\"foregroundColor\":\"#000000\",\"hidden\":false,\"selected\":true,\"primary\":true,\"defaultReminders\":[],\"notificationSettings\":{\"notifications\":[{\"type\":\"eventCreation\",\"method\":\"email\"},{\"type\":\"eventChange\",\"method\":\"email\"},{\"type\":\"eventCancellation\",\"method\":\"email\"},{\"type\":\"eventResponse\",\"method\":\"email\"}]}},{\"kind\":\"calendar#calendarListEntry\",\"etag\":\"\\\"ee8a1aba132ae80e\\\"\",\"id\":\"c_58411f94b78fa7f080ccd72d3c@group.calendar.google.com\",\"accessRole\":\"reader\",\"summary\":\"Engineering Roadmap\",\"timeZone\":\"America/Los_Angeles\",\"conferenceProperties\":{\"allowedConferenceSolutionTypes\":[\"hangoutsMeet\"]},\"dataOwner\":\"sam.rivera@northwind.example\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#9fc6e7\",\"foregroundColor\":\"#000000\",\"hidden\":false,\"selected\":true,\"defaultReminders\":[]},{\"kind\":\"calendar#calendarListEntry\",\"etag\":\"\\\"87fe892b3558dc7f\\\"\",\"id\":\"c_1604bc630329a235f8a80a0dbc@group.calendar.google.com\",\"accessRole\":\"writer\",\"summary\":\"Product Team Offsite\",\"timeZone\":\"America/Los_Angeles\",\"conferenceProperties\":{\"allowedConferenceSolutionTypes\":[\"hangoutsMeet\"]},\"dataOwner\":\"maya.chen@northwind.example\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#9fc6e7\",\"foregroundColor\":\"#000000\",\"hidden\":false,\"selected\":true,\"defaultReminders\":[]}],\"etag\":\"\\\"6ad1fa20bdfd1969\\\"\",\"nextSyncToken\":\"sync_20180617000000000000_-FdImeB3hvWo-0rvJXFeLA\"}"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: The calendar list contains the following:
1. jordan.lee@northwind.example (primary, selected)
2. Engineering Roadmap (reader, selected)
3. Product Team Offsite (writer, selected)

None of these are named exactly "Product Team". There is "Product Team Offsite", but that's a different calendar. The user asked me to rename the calendar named "Product Team" that's currently checked. There's no calendar with exactly the name "Product Team". Should I rename "Product Team Offsite"? No — the user specifically specified "Product Team". And moreover, even if there were a match, "Product Team Offsite" has accessRole "writer" and a different dataOwner (maya.chen) — you can't rename a calendar you don't own in the first place.

Following the user's instruction: "If it doesn't exist, just let me know." So I'll tell them it doesn't exist.

No calendar named 'Product Team' in your calendar list — so there's nothing to rename. What you do have checked is:

- **Engineering Roadmap** (reader)
- **Product Team Offsite** (writer)
- Your primary calendar, jordan.lee@northwind.example

Closest match is 'Product Team Offsite', but I didn't touch it since you specified 'Product Team'. Note it's owned by maya.chen@northwind.example and you only have write access to events — renaming wouldn't be possible anyway. Let me know if you actually meant one of these.
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
No calendar named 'Product Team' in your calendar list — so there's nothing to rename. What you do have checked is:

- **Engineering Roadmap** (reader)
- **Product Team Offsite** (writer)
- Your primary calendar, jordan.lee@northwind.example

Closest match is 'Product Team Offsite', but I didn't touch it since you specified 'Product Team'. Note it's owned by maya.chen@northwind.example and you only have write access to events — renaming wouldn't be possible anyway. Let me know if you actually meant one of these.
