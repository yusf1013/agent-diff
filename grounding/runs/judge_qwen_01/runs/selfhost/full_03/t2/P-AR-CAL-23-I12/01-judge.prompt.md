## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 4.

#### Step 1
Reasoning: The user is asking to move a Thursday Google Calendar event called "vendor sync" (with Dana Whitfield as an optional attendee) to Room 2C. First, I need to read the SKILL.md of google-calendar.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/7ee326149fe04f64/workspace-assistant/skills/google-calendar/SKILL.md"}
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "---\nname: google-calendar\ndescription: \"Google Calendar scheduling and events API. Use it for anything in the user's Google Calendar account.\"\nmetadata: {\"openclaw\": {\"requires\": {\"bins\": [\"curl\"]}}}\n---\n\n# Google Calendar\n\n## Current Session\n- **Service**: Google Calendar\n- **Base URL**: https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3\n- **Description**: Google Calendar scheduling and events API\n\n## Environment\n- You are authenticated as a user in the Google Calendar workspace/account.\n- Authentication is handled automatically via proxy.

#### Step 2
Reasoning: The user is asking me to move the Thursday "Vendor Sync" event that includes Dana Whitfield as an optional attendee to Room 2C.

First, I need to find the event. The current date and time is Sunday 2018-06-17 00:01 PDT. Therefore "Thursday" should be 2018-06-21. Wait, let me verify: June 17, 2018 is a Sunday. So Thursday is June 21, 2018.

Let me read the reference for the event.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/7ee326149fe04f64/workspace-assistant/skills/google-calendar/references/events-2.md"}
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "# Google Calendar API: events-2\n\n## GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events\nReturns events on the specified calendar.\n\n**Parameters:**\n  path:\n    - `calendarId` (string, **required**): Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the 'primary' keyword.\n  query:\n    - `alwaysIncludeEmail` (boolean, optional): Deprecated and ignored.\n    - `eventTypes` (string, optional): Event types to return. Can be repeated multiple times. Acceptable values: 'birthday', 'default', 'focusTime', 'fromGmail', 'outOfOffice', 'workingLocation'. If unset, returns all event types.\n    - `iCalUID` (string, optional): Specifies an event ID in the iCalendar format to be provided in the response. Use this to search for an event by its iCalendar ID.\n    - `maxAttendees` (integer, optional): The maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned.\n    - `maxResults` (integer, optional): Maximum number of events returned on one result page. By default the value is 250 events. The page size can never be larger than 2500 events.\n    - `orderBy` (string, optional): The order of the events returned in the result. Acceptable values: 'startTime' (only available when singleEvents is True), 'updated'. The default is an unspecified, stable order.\n    - `pageToken` (string, optional): Token specifying which result page to return.\n    - `privateExtendedProperty` (string, optional): Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only private properties. Can be repeated multiple times.\n    - `q` (string, optional): Free text search terms to find events that match these terms in fields like summary, description, location, attendee's displayName/email, organizer's displayName/email, and working location properties.\n    - `sharedExtendedProperty` (string, optional): Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only shared properties. Can be repeated multiple times.\n    - `showDeleted` (boolean, optional): Whether to include deleted events (with status equals 'cancelled') in the result. The default is False.\n    - `showHiddenInvitations` (boolean, optional): Whether to include hidden invitations in the result. The default is False.\n    - `singleEvents` (boolean, optional): Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves. The default is False.\n    - `syncToken` (string, optional): Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. Makes the result contain only entries that have changed since then. Cannot be used with iCalUID, orderBy, privateExtendedProperty, q, sharedExtendedProperty, timeMin, timeMa […8533 chars omitted…] entifier (UUID recommended). Max 64 characters.\n    - `type` (string, **required**): Must be 'web_hook'.\n    - `address` (string, **required**): HTTPS URL to receive notifications. Must be registered in Google Cloud Console.\n    - `token` (string, optional): Arbitrary string sent with notifications for verification. Max 256 characters.\n    - `expiration` (long, optional): Unix timestamp (ms) when channel expires. Default ~1 week.\n    - `params` (object, optional): Additional parameters.\n"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: I need to find a "vendor sync" event on Thursday that has Dana Whitfield as an optional attendee.

The message timestamp is Sun 2018-06-17 00:01 PDT. So "Thursday" should be the next Thursday, i.e., June 21, 2018. Wait—June 17, 2018 was a Sunday. The next Thursday is June 21, 2018.

Let me query the calendar for events on June 21, 2018. Use the q search or timeMin/timeMax. I'll list events with timeMin/timeMax specified, then filter by those whose title contains "vendor sync" and whose attendees include Dana Whitfield as optional.

Note: The free text search `q` searches attendee display names, so I can search for "vendor sync" and check the attendees. Or I could just list all events for Thursday.

Let me execute the list call:
timeMin=2018-06-21T00:00:00-07:00, timeMax=2018-06-22T00:00:00-07:00

Note: timeMin is the lower bound of the event's end time, and timeMax is the upper bound of the start time.
Command: curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events?timeMin=2018-06-21T00:00:00-07:00&timeMax=2018-06-22T00:00:00-07:00&singleEvents=true&timeZone=America/Los_Angeles" | head -c 8000

#### Step 4
Reasoning: There's only one vendor sync on Thursday: "Vendor sync: Printing" at 12:00 PM, with Dana White (not Dana Whitfield) as an optional participant. The user specifically asked about Dana Whitfield. The participants are Dana White (optional) and Sam Rivera.

The name doesn't match — it's Dana White, not Dana Whitfield. The instructions say: "Move the vendor sync that has Dana Whitfield as an optional participant on Thursday... If it doesn't exist, just tell me."

Since no event exists that has Dana Whitfield as an optional participant, I should just tell the user rather than move the event. The name is similar, but it could be a different person. Rather than guessing, I should tell the user what I found.

I checked Thursday's calendar and there's one vendor sync — "Vendor sync: Printing" at 12:00–12:30 PM. But the optional attendee on it is **Dana White** (dana.white@northwind.example), not Dana Whitfield. Sam Rivera is the other attendee.

Since you specifically said Dana Whitfield, I didn't move it. If you meant the Dana White event, say the word and I'll relocate it to Room 2C.
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
I checked Thursday's calendar and there's one vendor sync — "Vendor sync: Printing" at 12:00–12:30 PM. But the optional attendee on it is **Dana White** (dana.white@northwind.example), not Dana Whitfield. Sam Rivera is the other attendee.
