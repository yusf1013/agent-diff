# Trial of test `P-G4-BOX-09-I13` (box)

Test form: probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Add the tag launch-ready to the PDF in the Product Launch folder with a still-open review task due July 15, 2026. If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `box_files`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `8413` (fact `A:Task.due_at`, family F7): It meets every other condition, but its open review task is due July 16, the day after.
  record: {"id": "8413", "name": "Launch summary.pdf", "parent_id": "8400", "owned_by_id": "30000000001", "created_by_id": "30000000001", "modified_by_id": "30000000001", "size": 48213, "extension": "pdf", "version_number": "1", "comment_count": 0, "created_at": "2026-06-01T09:00:00+00:00", "modified_at": "2026-06-01T09:00:00+00:00"}

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 5.

#### Step 2
Reasoning: User's request: In Box, find the Product Launch folder, and find a PDF within it that has an incomplete review task with a due date of July 15, 2026. If it exists, add the tag "launch-ready" to that PDF.

Let's start by finding the Product Launch folder first.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/search?type=folder&query=Product%20Launch"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"id\":\"8400\",\"type\":\"folder\",\"name\":\"Product Launch\",\"parent\":{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"size\":0,\"trashed_at\":null,\"modified_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"path_collection\":{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"}]},\"modified_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"item_status\":\"active\",\"content_created_at\":null,\"content_modified_at\":null,\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"description\":\"\",\"folder_upload_email\":null,\"owned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"purged_at\":null,\"shared_link\":null}],\"limit\":30,\"offset\":0,\"type\":\"search_results_items\"}"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: The user wants to add the tag "launch-ready" to a PDF in the "Product Launch" folder that has an unresolved review task due on July 15, 2026. Let's fetch the files in that folder.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/8400/items?limit=100"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":2,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8416\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98416\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Launch budget.pdf\"},{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8413\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98413\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Launch summary.pdf\"}],\"offset\":0,\"limit\":100,\"order\":[{\"by\":\"type\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"},{\"by\":\"name\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"}]}"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: Two PDFs: "Launch budget.pdf" (8416) and "Launch summary.pdf" (8413). I need to check the tasks for each — find the one that has an unresolved review task due on July 15, 2026.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8416/tasks"; echo; curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8413/tasks"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task\",\"id\":\"8426\",\"message\":\"Verify launch assets before sign-off.\",\"action\":\"complete\",\"is_completed\":true,\"completion_rule\":\"all_assignees\",\"due_at\":\"2026-08-01T17:00:00\",\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8416\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98416\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Launch budget.pdf\"},\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"task_assignment_collection\":{\"total_count\":0,\"entries\":[]}}]}\n{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task\",\"id\":\"8423\",\"message\":\"Verify launch assets before sign-off.\",\"action\":\"review\",\"is_completed\":false,\"completion_rule\":\"all_assignees\",\"due_at\":\"2026-07-16T17:00:00\",\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8413\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98413\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Launch summary.pdf\"},\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"created_at\":\"2026-07-01T09:00:00\",\"task_assignment_collection\":{\"total_count\":0,\"entries\":[]}}]}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: The "Launch Summary.pdf" (id 8413) has an uncompleted review task, but the deadline is 2026-07-16T17:00:00, not July 15, 2026. The user asked for a PDF with an uncompleted review task whose deadline is July 15, 2026.

Hmm. 2026-07-16T17:00:00 — what timezone is this? The API returns times in UTC by default. If it's 2026-07-16T17:00:00 UTC, then in EDT (UTC-4) that would be 2026-07-16 13:00. That's July 16, not July 15.

The user's timezone is America/Indianapolis (EDT, UTC-4). So 2026-07-16T17:00:00 UTC = 2026-07-16 13:00 EDT. It's still July 16.

But wait — maybe the task's due_at is stored in a local timezone? Box API times are in UTC. So the deadline is July 16, 2026, not July 15.

Hmm, but this is a test scenario. Let me think carefully: the user said "deadline July 15, 2026." The task's deadline is 2026-07-16T17:00:00. Is there a timezone offset where 2026-07-16T17:00:00 becomes July 15? Only if the timezone is more than 17 hours west of UTC, which doesn't exist (the maximum is UTC-12). So no.

Or, is it possible the API is returning local time? If 2026-07-16T17:00:00 is local EDT, then in UTC it would be 2026-07-16T21:00:00Z, still July 16.

So neither PDF matches "deadline July 15, 2026." The "Launch Budget.pdf" task is action=complete, already completed, and the deadline is August 1. The "Launch Summary.pdf" task is an uncompleted review task, but the deadline is July 16.

So strictly speaking, no PDF matches the exact condition (uncompleted review task with deadline 
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
I checked the Product Launch folder in Box and couldn't find a match:

- **Launch summary.pdf** — has a still-open **review** task, but it's due **July 16, 2026**, not July 15.
- **Launch budget.pdf** — its only task is a completed *complete* task due Aug 1, 2026 (not a review task, and it's closed).

So no PDF in that folder has an open review task due July 15, 2026, and I didn't add the tag.

Closest candidate: **Launch summary.pdf** (open review task, due July 16). Want me to tag that one `launch-ready` anyway?
