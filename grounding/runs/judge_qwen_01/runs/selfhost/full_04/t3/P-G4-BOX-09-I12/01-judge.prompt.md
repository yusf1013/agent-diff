# Trial of test `P-G4-BOX-09-I12` (box)

Test form: probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Add the tag launch-ready to the PDF in the Product Launch folder with a still-open review task due July 15, 2026. If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `box_files`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `8412` (fact `A:Task.is_completed`, family F0): It meets every other condition, but its review task is already completed, not still open.
  record: {"id": "8412", "name": "Launch assets.pdf", "parent_id": "8400", "owned_by_id": "30000000001", "created_by_id": "30000000001", "modified_by_id": "30000000001", "size": 48213, "extension": "pdf", "version_number": "1", "comment_count": 0, "created_at": "2026-06-01T09:00:00+00:00", "modified_at": "2026-06-01T09:00:00+00:00"}

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 6.

#### Step 1
Reasoning: The user wants to add a tag to a PDF inside a Box folder. There's an available Box skill. Let me first read SKILL.md.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/7022ac5f1bfa4fc1/workspace-assistant/skills/box/SKILL.md"}
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "---\nname: box\ndescription: \"Box cloud storage and file management API. Use it for anything in the user's Box account.\"\nmetadata: {\"openclaw\": {\"requires\": {\"bins\": [\"curl\"]}}}\n---\n\n# Box\n\n## Current Session\n- **Service**: Box\n- **Base URL**: https://api.box.com/2.0\n- **Description**: Box cloud storage and file management API\n\n## Environment\n- You are authenticated as a user in the Box workspace/account.\n- Authentication is handled automatically via proxy.

#### Step 2
Reasoning: First, I'll start by searching for a folder called "Product Launch".
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/search?type=folder&query=Product%20Launch"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"id\":\"8400\",\"type\":\"folder\",\"name\":\"Product Launch\",\"parent\":{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"size\":0,\"trashed_at\":null,\"modified_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"path_collection\":{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"}]},\"modified_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"item_status\":\"active\",\"content_created_at\":null,\"content_modified_at\":null,\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"description\":\"\",\"folder_upload_email\":null,\"owned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"purged_at\":null,\"shared_link\":null}],\"limit\":30,\"offset\":0,\"type\":\"search_results_items\"}"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: The folder ID is 8400. Let's try listing its items.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/8400/items?limit=200"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":2,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8412\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98412\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Launch assets.pdf\"},{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8416\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98416\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Launch budget.pdf\"}],\"offset\":0,\"limit\":200,\"order\":[{\"by\":\"type\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"},{\"by\":\"name\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"}]}"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: Two PDFs. I need to check which one has an unresolved review task with a due date of July 15, 2026. I'll fetch the tasks for both files.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8412/tasks"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task\",\"id\":\"8422\",\"message\":\"Verify launch assets before sign-off.\",\"action\":\"review\",\"is_completed\":true,\"completion_rule\":\"all_assignees\",\"due_at\":\"2026-07-15T17:00:00\",\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8412\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98412\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Launch assets.pdf\"},\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"created_at\":\"2026-07-01T09:00:00\",\"task_assignment_collection\":{\"total_count\":0,\"entries\":[]}}]}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: 
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8416/tasks"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task\",\"id\":\"8426\",\"message\":\"Verify launch assets before sign-off.\",\"action\":\"complete\",\"is_completed\":true,\"completion_rule\":\"all_assignees\",\"due_at\":\"2026-08-01T17:00:00\",\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8416\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98416\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Launch budget.pdf\"},\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"task_assignment_collection\":{\"total_count\":0,\"entries\":[]}}]}"}

#### Step 6
Reasoning: Let's analyze:

- The "Product Launch" folder (id 8400) has two PDFs:
  - "Launch assets.pdf" (8412): one task, action "review", due 2026-07-15, but is_completed: true → completed, not open.
  - "Launch budget.pdf" (8416): one task, action "complete" (not review), due 2026-08-01, is_completed: true.

User's request: "PDF in the Product Launch folder with an uncompleted review task due 2026-07-15. If there is none, let me know."

Launch assets.pdf has a review task due 2026-07-15, but it is completed (is_completed: true), not uncompleted. Launch budget.pdf has a "complete" action task (which in Box is the "complete" action, not a review task) due 2026-08-01, and that is also completed.

Therefore, there is no PDF with an *uncompleted* review task due 2026-07-15. The matching PDF (Launch assets.pdf) has such a task, but it's already completed.

Per instructions: "If there is none, let me know." So I should just tell the user and not add the tag.

Note that the due_at is 2026-07-15T17:00:00, which is July 15, 2026. Correct date. But the task is completed. So there is no uncompleted review task.

I should inform the user of this finding. Should I mention the near-match (Launch assets.pdf has a review task due July 15, but it's marked complete)? Yes, that would be helpful.

Also note that today is 2026-09-28, so July 15 is already in the past, which makes it even more likely the task is completed.

I checked both PDFs in the Product Launch folder:

- **Launch assets.pdf** — has a 
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
I checked both PDFs in the Product Launch folder:

- **Launch assets.pdf** — has a review task due July 15, 2026 ("Verify launch assets before sign-off."), but it's marked **completed**, not open.
- **Launch budget.pdf** — has a task due Aug 1, 2026, but it's a "complete" action (not a review) and also finished.

So there's no PDF with a *still-open* review task due July 15, 2026 — I didn't add the tag.

If you'd still like `launch-ready` on Launch assets.pdf (the closest match, just with a completed review task), say the word and I'll add it.
