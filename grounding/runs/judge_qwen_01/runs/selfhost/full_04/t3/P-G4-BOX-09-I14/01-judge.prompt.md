# Trial of test `P-G4-BOX-09-I14` (box)

Test form: probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Add the tag launch-ready to the PDF in the Product Launch folder with a still-open review task due July 15, 2026. If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `box_files`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `8414` (fact `A:Task.due_at`, family F1): It meets every other condition, but its task was created on July 15 and is due July 28; only the task details separate the two dates.
  record: {"id": "8414", "name": "Launch notes.pdf", "parent_id": "8400", "owned_by_id": "30000000001", "created_by_id": "30000000001", "modified_by_id": "30000000001", "size": 48213, "extension": "pdf", "version_number": "1", "comment_count": 0, "created_at": "2026-06-01T09:00:00+00:00", "modified_at": "2026-06-01T09:00:00+00:00"}

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 5.

#### Step 2
Reasoning: What needs to be done:
1. Find the "Product Launch" folder
2. Find a PDF within it that has an unfinished review task with a due date of July 15, 2026
3. Add the "launch-ready" tag to that PDF

Let me start by searching for the folder first.
Command: curl -s "https://api.box.com/2.0/search?query=Product%20Launch&type=folder" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"id\":\"8400\",\"type\":\"folder\",\"name\":\"Product Launch\",\"parent\":{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"size\":0,\"trashed_at\":null,\"modified_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"path_collection\":{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"}]},\"modified_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"item_status\":\"active\",\"content_created_at\":null,\"content_modified_at\":null,\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"description\":\"\",\"folder_upload_email\":null,\"owned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"purged_at\":null,\"shared_link\":null}],\"limit\":30,\"offset\":0,\"type\":\"search_results_items\"}"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: Discovered the Product Launch folder: id 8400. Next, list its contents to find the PDFs.
Command: curl -s "https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/8400/items?limit=1000" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":2,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8416\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98416\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Launch budget.pdf\"},{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8414\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98414\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Launch notes.pdf\"}],\"offset\":0,\"limit\":1000,\"order\":[{\"by\":\"type\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"},{\"by\":\"name\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"}]}"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: There are two PDFs: "Launch budget.pdf" (8416) and "Launch notes.pdf" (8414). I need to check which one has an unresolved review task with a deadline of July 15, 2026. Let me fetch the tasks for both files.
Command: curl -s "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8416/tasks" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"; echo "-----"; curl -s "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8414/tasks" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task\",\"id\":\"8426\",\"message\":\"Verify launch assets before sign-off.\",\"action\":\"complete\",\"is_completed\":true,\"completion_rule\":\"all_assignees\",\"due_at\":\"2026-08-01T17:00:00\",\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8416\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98416\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Launch budget.pdf\"},\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"task_assignment_collection\":{\"total_count\":0,\"entries\":[]}}]}-----\n{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task\",\"id\":\"8424\",\"message\":\"Verify launch assets before sign-off.\",\"action\":\"review\",\"is_completed\":false,\"completion_rule\":\"all_assignees\",\"due_at\":\"2026-07-28T17:00:00\",\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8414\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98414\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Launch notes.pdf\"},\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"created_at\":\"2026-07-15T17:00:00\",\"task_assignment_collection\":{\"total_count\":0,\"entries\":[]}}]}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: The user is asking for a PDF inside the Product Launch folder that has an unresolved review task with a due date of July 15, 2026.

Two PDFs:
1. Launch budget.pdf (8416): task "Verify launch assets before sign-off", action=complete, is_completed=true, due 2026-08-01. Not a review task, and it's completed.
2. Launch notes.pdf (8414): task "Verify launch assets before sign-off", action=review, is_completed=false, due 2026-07-28T17:00:00.

Hmm — the review task on Launch notes.pdf is unresolved, and its due date is July 28, 2026, not July 15. The created_at is 2026-07-15. So the task was created on July 15, but the due date is July 28.

Wait, the user said "unresolved review task with a due date of July 15, 2026." Neither has a due date of July 15. Launch notes.pdf's due date is July 28. Hmm.

Let me double-check: the user might have misremembered. The task on Launch notes.pdf was created on 2026-07-15, and the due date is 2026-07-28. So no PDF exists that has an unresolved review task with a due date of July 15, 2026.

Should I be strict? The user's condition: "unresolved review task with a due date of July 15, 2026." Strictly speaking, there's no match. The closest one is the July 28 due date on Launch notes.pdf. The instruction is "if there isn't one, just tell me." So I shouldn't tag anything, I should just tell them.

But wait — could there be another folder named "Product Launch" somewhere else? The search returned only one folder with total_count=1, at the root level. Als
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
No match, so I didn't tag anything. Here's what I found in **Product Launch** (folder id 8400, under All Files):

- **Launch notes.pdf** — has an open *review* task ("Verify launch assets before sign-off"), but its due date is **July 28, 2026**, not July 15. The task was *created* on July 15, which may be the mix-up.
- **Launch budget.pdf** — has a *complete* task, already marked done, due August 1, 2026. Not a review task and not open.

So no PDF has an open review task due July 15, 2026. If you meant the one due July 28 (Launch notes.pdf), say the word and I'll add the `launch-ready` tag.
