# Trial of test `P-G4-BOX-04-I15` (box)

Test form: probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Add the tag q3-signoff to the PDF in the Budget Reviews folder with the review task Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen that she approved. If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `box_files`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `8106` (fact `B:TaskAssignment.task_id`, family F5): Maya Chen's assignment is still incomplete; the approved assignment on that task belongs to Omar Haddad.

#### Step 2
Reasoning: Let's understand the task:
1. Find the "Budget Reviews" folder in Box
2. Within that folder, find a PDF that has a review task assigned by Leo Park to Maya Chen, which she approved
3. Add the tag "q3-signoff" to that PDF
4. If no such PDF exists, just let the user know

Note: The task list in SKILL.md contains GET /files/{file_id}/tasks. To find the task assignee (Leo Park) and the completion status by Maya Chen (approved), I need to check the task details. Task assignments include an "assigned_to" user, and task assignment completion status is... In the Box API, GET /files/{file_id}/tasks returns tasks with assignment information. Each assignment has "assigned_to", and there might also be "completed_at" and the assignee who completed it.

First, let's find the Budget Reviews folder. I'll either search or list the root folder.

I'll start by first searching for the "Budget Reviews" folder.
Command: curl -s "https://api.box.com/2.0/search?query=Budget%20Reviews&type=folder" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"id\":\"8100\",\"type\":\"folder\",\"name\":\"Budget Reviews\",\"parent\":{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"size\":0,\"trashed_at\":null,\"modified_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"path_collection\":{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"}]},\"modified_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"item_status\":\"active\",\"content_created_at\":null,\"content_modified_at\":null,\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"description\":\"\",\"folder_upload_email\":null,\"owned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"purged_at\":null,\"shared_link\":null}],\"limit\":30,\"offset\":0,\"type\":\"search_results_items\"}"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: Found the "Budget Reviews" folder with id 8100. Next, I'll list the items in the folder and look for PDFs that have review tasks assigned to Maya Chen by Leo Park, and that she approved.
Command: curl -s "https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/8100/items?limit=100" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8106\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98106\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Q3 budget appendix.pdf\"}],\"offset\":0,\"limit\":100,\"order\":[{\"by\":\"type\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"},{\"by\":\"name\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"}]}"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: There's one PDF: "Q3 Budget Appendix.pdf", ID 8106. Next, I need to check the tasks on this file — I'm looking for a review task that Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen, and Maya has approved it.
Command: curl -s "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8106/tasks" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task\",\"id\":\"9106\",\"message\":\"Please review the Q3 budget figures\",\"action\":\"review\",\"is_completed\":false,\"completion_rule\":\"all_assignees\",\"due_at\":null,\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8106\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98106\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Q3 budget appendix.pdf\"},\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000006\",\"name\":\"Priya Nair\",\"login\":\"priya.nair@northwind.example\"},\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"task_assignment_collection\":{\"total_count\":2,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task_assignment\",\"id\":\"9206\",\"message\":null,\"resolution_state\":\"incomplete\",\"assigned_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"reminded_at\":null,\"completed_at\":null,\"assigned_to\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000002\",\"name\":\"Maya Chen\",\"login\":\"maya.chen@northwind.example\"},\"assigned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000004\",\"name\":\"Leo Park\",\"login\":\"leo.park@northwind.example\"},\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8106\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98106\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Q3 budget appendix.pdf\"}},{\"type\":\"task_assignment\",\"id\":\"9207\",\"message\":null,\"resolution_state\":\"approved\",\"assigned_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"reminded_at\":null,\"completed_at\":null,\"assigned_to\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000007\",\"name\":\"Omar Haddad\",\"login\":\"omar.haddad@northwind.example\"},\"assigned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000004\",\"name\":\"Leo Park\",\"login\":\"leo.park@northwind.example\"},\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8106\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98106\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Q3 budget appendix.pdf\"}}]}}]}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: Let me carefully analyze this.

Task: "Please add the tag q3-signoff to the PDF in the Budget Reviews folder for the review task that Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen and that she approved. If there is no such task, just tell me."

In other words, I need to find a PDF inside the "Budget Reviews" folder. There is one PDF: "Q3 budget appendix.pdf" (id 8106).

Next, I need a review task assigned by Leo Park to Maya Chen that Maya Chen approved.

Looking at the task data:
- Task id 9106: "Please review the Q3 budget figures", action "review", created by Priya Nair (id 30000000006).
- Assignments:
  - Assignment 9206: assigned to Maya Chen (id 30000000002), assigned by Leo Park (id 30000000004), resolution_state "incomplete", is_completed false.
  - Assignment 9207: assigned to Omar Haddad (id 30000000007), assigned by Leo Park, resolution_state "approved".

So the review task Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen: assignment 9206 exists (Leo assigned to Maya). But was it approved by her? No—Maya's assignment (9206) has resolution_state "incomplete", not approved. The one that's "approved" is Omar Haddad's assignment, not Maya's.

Wait, let me re-read. "The review task that Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen and that she approved." "she" = Maya Chen. So I need a task that Leo assigned to Maya and that Maya approved.

Maya's assignment: assigned_by Leo Park ✓, but resolution_state is "incomplete", not "approved". So Maya did not approve.

Omar's assignment is approved, but that's assigned to Om
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
I found the folder and checked, but I can't add the tag — the task you described doesn't exist as specified. Here's what's actually in **Budget Reviews**:

- **PDF:** `Q3 budget appendix.pdf` (the only file in the folder)
- **Review task:** "Please review the Q3 budget figures" (created by Priya Nair, 2026-06-01), with two assignments both made by **Leo Park**:
  - **Maya Chen** — resolution state: **incomplete** (she did *not* approve it)
  - **Omar Haddad** — resolution state: **approved**

So Leo Park did assign a review task to Maya Chen, but the one she approved doesn't exist — her assignment is still open/incomplete. The only approval on that task came from **Omar Haddad**, not Maya.

No tag was added. If you meant the file regardless (or specifically the one Omar approved, or want me to tag the PDF even though Maya hasn't approved), just say the word and I'll add `q3-signoff`.
