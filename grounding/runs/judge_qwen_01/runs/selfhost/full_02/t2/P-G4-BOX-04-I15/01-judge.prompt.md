# Trial of test `P-G4-BOX-04-I15` (box)

Test form: probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Add the tag q3-signoff to the PDF in the Budget Reviews folder with the review task Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen that she approved. If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `box_files`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `8106` (fact `B:TaskAssignment.task_id`, family F5): Maya Chen's assignment is still incomplete; the approved assignment on that task belongs to Omar Haddad.

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 5.

#### Step 1
Reasoning: The user is asking me to work within Box. Let me first read the Box skill's SKILL.md, and then handle the task.

Task: Add the tag "q3-signoff" to a PDF inside the "Budget Reviews" folder. This is one that has a review task assigned by Leo Park to Maya Chen, and that task was approved by Maya Chen. If no such PDF exists, report it.

Let me read the skill first.

#### Step 2
Reasoning: Task: In Box, find the "Budget Reviews" folder, find a PDF inside it that has a review task assigned by Leo Park to Maya Chen, and that task has been approved (completed). Add the tag "q3-signoff" to that PDF. If no such PDF exists, just tell the user.

Plan:
1. Search for the "Budget Reviews" folder.
2. List the items in that folder (PDFs).
3. For each PDF, get its tasks and check for tasks where the assignment has Leo Park as the assigner, Maya Chen as the assignee, and the completion status as "completed".
4. To verify the names, I may need to resolve user IDs. I can either search for users by name, or check the task's assigned_to / assigned_by fields. The GET /files/{file_id}/tasks response includes assignments with assigned_to and assigned_by user objects.

Note: According to the skill, authentication is automatically handled via a proxy — use a placeholder token like <TOKEN>. That means I should use a curl command with Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>.

Let's start by searching for the folder first.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/search?type=folder&query=Budget%20Reviews"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"id\":\"8100\",\"type\":\"folder\",\"name\":\"Budget Reviews\",\"parent\":{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"size\":0,\"trashed_at\":null,\"modified_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"path_collection\":{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"}]},\"modified_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"item_status\":\"active\",\"content_created_at\":null,\"content_modified_at\":null,\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"description\":\"\",\"folder_upload_email\":null,\"owned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"purged_at\":null,\"shared_link\":null}],\"limit\":30,\"offset\":0,\"type\":\"search_results_items\"}"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: Found the Budget Reviews folder (ID: 8100). Next, let's list the items within it.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/8100/items?limit=100"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8106\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98106\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Q3 budget appendix.pdf\"}],\"offset\":0,\"limit\":100,\"order\":[{\"by\":\"type\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"},{\"by\":\"name\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"}]}"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: I need to investigate this further. Let me check the details.

There's one PDF: "Q3 budget appendix.pdf", id 8106. Next, I need to check the tasks on this file and look for a review task that Leo Park assigned to Maya Chen that was approved/completed.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8106/tasks"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task\",\"id\":\"9106\",\"message\":\"Please review the Q3 budget figures\",\"action\":\"review\",\"is_completed\":false,\"completion_rule\":\"all_assignees\",\"due_at\":null,\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8106\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98106\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Q3 budget appendix.pdf\"},\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000006\",\"name\":\"Priya Nair\",\"login\":\"priya.nair@northwind.example\"},\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"task_assignment_collection\":{\"total_count\":2,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task_assignment\",\"id\":\"9206\",\"message\":null,\"resolution_state\":\"incomplete\",\"assigned_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"reminded_at\":null,\"completed_at\":null,\"assigned_to\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000002\",\"name\":\"Maya Chen\",\"login\":\"maya.chen@northwind.example\"},\"assigned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000004\",\"name\":\"Leo Park\",\"login\":\"leo.park@northwind.example\"},\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8106\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98106\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Q3 budget appendix.pdf\"}},{\"type\":\"task_assignment\",\"id\":\"9207\",\"message\":null,\"resolution_state\":\"approved\",\"assigned_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"reminded_at\":null,\"completed_at\":null,\"assigned_to\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000007\",\"name\":\"Omar Haddad\",\"login\":\"omar.haddad@northwind.example\"},\"assigned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000004\",\"name\":\"Leo Park\",\"login\":\"leo.park@northwind.example\"},\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8106\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98106\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Q3 budget appendix.pdf\"}}]}}]}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: The user is asking for a PDF in the "Budget Reviews" folder that meets the following conditions:
- A review task assigned to Maya Chen by Leo Park
- That task was approved (by Maya Chen)

Let's check the tasks:
- File: 8106 "Q3 budget appendix.pdf" — one PDF in the folder.
- Task 9106: a review task created by Priya Nair. Assignments:
  - Assignment 9206: assigned to Maya Chen by Leo Park, resolution_state: "incomplete" — not approved.
  - Assignment 9207: assigned to Omar Haddad by Leo Park, resolution_state: "approved".

So, there is no task that was both assigned to Maya Chen AND approved. Maya Chen's assignment is "incomplete". The approval was made by Omar Haddad.

There's only one file in the folder, so no need to check others. But just to be safe, let's verify there are no other files — total_count is 1, so this is the only one.

According to the user's instructions: "If it doesn't exist, just tell me." So, I should report that no such PDF exists: the only review task assigned to Maya Chen by Leo Park on the PDF in the folder is still incomplete, and the approved assignment is on Omar Haddad's side.

I won't add the tag. I'll report the situation.

No matching PDF found — so I didn't tag anything.

Here's what's in the **Budget Reviews** folder:

- **Q3 budget appendix.pdf** (file ID 8106) — the only file there.
- It has one review task ("Please review the Q3 budget figures"), assigned to two people by Leo Park:
  - **Maya Chen** — status is still **incomplete** (not a
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
No matching PDF found — so I didn't tag anything.

Here's what's in the **Budget Reviews** folder:

- **Q3 budget appendix.pdf** (file ID 8106) — the only file there.
- It has one review task ("Please review the Q3 budget figures"), assigned to two people by Leo Park:
  - **Maya Chen** — status is still **incomplete** (not approved)
  - **Omar Haddad** — this one is **approved**

So the task Leo assigned to Maya hasn't been approved yet — the approval came from Omar. If you'd like, I can tag the file anyway, or I can check again once Maya completes her part.
