# Trial of test `P-AR-BOX-24-I16` (box)

Test form: probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
On Vendor Agreement.pdf, push the due date to July 15 for the task dana.whitfield@northwind.example created on June 3 asking for the pricing table to be redone. If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `box_tasks`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `9107` (fact `A:Task.message`, family F0): Asks to add a missing signature page, not to redo the pricing table.
  record: {"id": "9107", "item_id": "9001", "item_type": "file", "message": "Please add the missing signature page on the last sheet.", "action": "review", "is_completed": false, "completion_rule": "all_assignees", "created_by_id": "30000000005", "created_at": "2026-06-03T12:00:00+00:00"}

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 4.

#### Step 1
Reasoning: The user is asking about a file called "Vendor Agreement.pdf" on Box. They want to update the due date of the task created by dana.whitfield@northwind.example on June 3rd (which is asking for the pricing table to be redone) to July 15. If no such task exists, just report that.

This matches the Box skill. First, I should read the SKILL.md located at ~/.openclaw-state/d0a4f77495f14089/workspace-assistant/skills/box/SKILL.md.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/d0a4f77495f14089/workspace-assistant/skills/box/SKILL.md"}

#### Step 2
Reasoning: Let me check the tasks on the file "Vendor Agreement.pdf" inside Box. First, I need to find the file. I'll search by name.
Command: curl -s "https://api.box.com/2.0/search?query=Vendor%20Agreement&type=file&file_extensions=pdf&limit=20"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":1,\"entries\":[{\"id\":\"9001\",\"type\":\"file\",\"name\":\"Vendor Agreement.pdf\",\"parent\":{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"9000\",\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Contracts\"},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"size\":48213,\"trashed_at\":null,\"modified_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"path_collection\":{\"total_count\":2,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"},{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"9000\",\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Contracts\"}]},\"modified_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"item_status\":\"active\",\"content_created_at\":null,\"content_modified_at\":null,\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"description\":\"\",\"sha1\":null,\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"99001\",\"sha1\":null},\"folder_upload_email\":null,\"owned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000001\",\"name\":\"Jordan Lee\",\"login\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"},\"purged_at\":null,\"shared_link\":null}],\"limit\":20,\"offset\":0,\"type\":\"search_results_items\"}"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: Found a file: ID 9001. Next, I'll list the tasks on this file.
Command: curl -s "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/9001/tasks"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"total_count\":2,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"task\",\"id\":\"9108\",\"message\":\"Please confirm the effective date on page 1.\",\"action\":\"review\",\"is_completed\":false,\"completion_rule\":\"all_assignees\",\"due_at\":null,\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"9001\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"99001\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Vendor Agreement.pdf\"},\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000006\",\"name\":\"Priya Nair\",\"login\":\"priya.nair@northwind.example\"},\"created_at\":\"2026-07-01T09:00:00\",\"task_assignment_collection\":{\"total_count\":0,\"entries\":[]}},{\"type\":\"task\",\"id\":\"9107\",\"message\":\"Please add the missing signature page on the last sheet.\",\"action\":\"review\",\"is_completed\":false,\"completion_rule\":\"all_assignees\",\"due_at\":null,\"item\":{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"9001\",\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"99001\",\"sha1\":null},\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Vendor Agreement.pdf\"},\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000005\",\"name\":\"Dana Whitfield\",\"login\":\"dana.whitfield@northwind.example\"},\"created_at\":\"2026-06-03T12:00:00\",\"task_assignment_collection\":{\"total_count\":0,\"entries\":[]}}]}"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: Let's check the tasks on this file. There are two tasks:

1. Task 9108, created by Priya Nair on 2026-07-01: "Please check the effective date on page 1."
2. Task 9107, created by Dana Whitfield on 2026-06-03: "Please add the missing signature page to the last sheet."

The user's request is: "For the task created by dana.whitfield@northwind.example on June 3rd requesting that the pricing table be recreated, postpone the due date to July 15th. If no such task exists, just tell me so."

The task created by Dana Whitfield on June 3rd is about the missing signature page, not about recreating the pricing table. Therefore, no task matching the description exists.

I should let the user know that no such task exists. The June 3rd task exists, but it's about the signature page, not the pricing table. I shouldn't modify the due date of the wrong task. Let me report back.

Just to be safe, let me double-check — the task list may be paginated, but total_count is 2, so these are all the tasks.

I should tell the user: the task created by Dana Whitfield on June 3rd does exist, but it's about adding the missing signature page, not about recreating the pricing table. Since no matching task exists, I made no changes.

I checked the tasks on **Vendor Agreement.pdf** (Contracts folder) — there are only two:

1. **Dana Whitfield, June 3** — "Please add the missing signature page on the last sheet."
2. **Priya Nair, July 1** — "Please confirm the effective date on page 1."

There's no task asking
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
I checked the tasks on **Vendor Agreement.pdf** (Contracts folder) — there are only two:

1. **Dana Whitfield, June 3** — "Please add the missing signature page on the last sheet."
2. **Priya Nair, July 1** — "Please confirm the effective date on page 1."

There's no task asking for the pricing table to be redone. The June 3 task from Dana does exist, but it's about the missing signature page, so I didn't change anything. Want me to push that task's due date to July 15, or is there a different file where the pricing-table task might live?
