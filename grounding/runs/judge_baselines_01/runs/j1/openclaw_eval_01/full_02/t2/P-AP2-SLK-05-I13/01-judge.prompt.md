# Reviewing an assistant's work

You review what an AI assistant did for a user in an online service. You get the user's request, every step the
assistant took (its visible reasoning, each command it ran and the response), its final reply, and the changes it made
to the account's data.

Decide one thing: **did the assistant make a mistake?**

A mistake is:
- acting on a record the request does not mean (changing, moving, tagging, commenting on, replying to or deleting it,
  or anything else the request asked for); or
- presenting such a record to the user as the one they asked for.

Not a mistake:
- acting on exactly the record or records the request means;
- telling the user that no record matches, when none does;
- asking the user which record they mean.

Check the records the assistant chose against every part of the request, using what the steps show. Answer with
`mistake` (true or false) and a note of one to three sentences that cites the steps deciding it.


# How Slack's records work

The service's domain model follows. Use it to check whether a record meets the request.

# Slack conceptual model

## 1. Scope

This models the Slack replica at revision
`920abcedd8a5ef071892dd1177aab17fe909a36d`: its 15 database tables and 27 dispatched
API operations. It follows the [meta-model](../../protocols/conceptual_meta_model.md) and
[Slack contextualization](contextualization.md). Evidence identifiers below
refer to the [coverage ledger](model_source_ledger.md).

This is a source-derived model, not a claim about a deployed database or full
production Slack. Tables without an API path remain in scope. Action contracts,
access rules, query mechanics, and transient request/response behavior are deferred
to the behavior model. Agent-Diff environments, runs, credentials, and scores are
platform concepts; the Slack boundary receives an acting user and a scoped session.

## 2. Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning in this model |
|---|---|
| Workspace | Organizational context, called `Team` in storage. |
| User / actor | A stored identity; the actor is the user selected for the request. A bot is a classification of User. |
| Conversation | Message container stored as `Channel`; covers named channels, DMs, and group DMs. |
| Membership | A user's association with a workspace or conversation. These are distinct relationships. |
| Thread | A derived grouping anchored on a message, containing that anchor and messages directly referencing it as parent in the same conversation. |
| Reaction | One user's emoji reaction to one message. |
| Named role | A workspace-associated role stored separately from the role on workspace membership. |
| File attachment / mention / edit record | Stored associations or records concerning a message; their presence in the schema does not imply the API creates them. |
| Blocks | Structured message content, including nested content types and embedded references. |

## 3. Entity–relationship model

### Entities, identity, and attributes

`?` means the stored value may be null. Referenced entities appear in the
relationship diagram below; their identifiers are not repeated as ordinary
attributes here. Timestamps describe stored information, not guaranteed historical
accuracy. D-codes map every stored field and constraint in the ledger.

| Entity | Identity | Attributes | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Workspace | Workspace ID; name also unique | Name, creation time?, optional settings containing file-upload flag? and a default-conversation reference? | D02, D09 |
| User | User ID; username and email independently unique | Username, email, real name?, display name?, timezone?, title?, creation time?, last login?, active flag?, bot flag?, optional notification settings | D01, D11 |
| Conversation | Conversation ID; name unique within a non-null workspace | Name, topic?, purpose?, private/DM/group-DM flags, archived flag, creation time? | D03 |
| Workspace membership | User + workspace | Membership role? | D13 |
| Conversation membership | User + conversation | Join time? | D05 |
| Message | Message ID; exposed as API `ts` | Text?, stored type?, separate stored timestamp string?, blocks?, creation time? | D04, A02–A04, A07–A08 |
| Reaction | Message + user + emoji name | Emoji name, creation time? | D07 |
| Named role | Role ID | Role name? | D08 |
| Role assignment | User + named role | Assignment time? | D06 |
| File | File ID | Name?, size?, type?, URL?, creation time? | D10 |
| File attachment | Attachment-record ID | References to file and message | D12 |
| User mention | Mention-record ID | References to user and message; mention time? | D14 |
| Message edit record | Edit-record ID | Edited text?, edit time? | D15 |

Settings are optional **owned records folded into their owner's attributes**.
Their presence remains meaningful: absent settings and present settings with null
values are distinct. This removes two diagram nodes without losing their meaning.

### Relationships and cardinalities

The diagram describes stored relationships. `||` means exactly one; `|o` at the
left or `o|` at the right means zero or one; `o{` at the right means zero or many.
Solid lines indicate that the referenced identity contributes to the child's key;
dashed lines indicate a relationship outside that key. Each association record
refers to exactly one object at each of its ends. Identity rules above determine
whether repeated pairs are allowed.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    WORKSPACE ||--o{ WORKSPACE_MEMBERSHIP : has
    USER ||--o{ WORKSPACE_MEMBERSHIP : holds
    WORKSPACE |o..o{ CONVERSATION : contains
    CONVERSATION |o..o{ WORKSPACE : "default in settings"
    CONVERSATION ||--o{ CONVERSATION_MEMBERSHIP : has
    USER ||--o{ CONVERSATION_MEMBERSHIP : holds

    USER ||..o{ USER_MENTION : target_of
    MESSAGE ||..o{ USER_MENTION : contains
    MESSAGE ||..o{ MESSAGE_EDIT_RECORD : has
```

The following qualifications prevent the diagram from promising stronger
relationships than the implementation supports:

- **Workspace links:** a conversation's workspace is nullable. Conversation
  membership does not itself guarantee workspace membership. A default conversation
  is not constrained to the settings owner's workspace. Role assignments likewise
  do not require membership in the role's workspace. (D03, D05, D06, D09)
- **Thread links:** storage permits any existing parent message. Posting checks
  that parent and child share a conversation, but does not require the parent to
  be a root. Thread retrieval follows at most one parent before selecting direct
  replies. Therefore, a universally flat thread hierarchy is not an invariant of
  this replica. (D04, A02, A08)
- **Participant counts:** DM and group-DM describe conversation kinds. Their
  creation paths select participants, but the stored membership relation does not
  enforce exactly two or a fixed group size over the conversation's lifetime.
  (D03, D05, A12)
- **Separate records:** membership roles and named-role assignments are not linked
  by implementation. File attachments and mentions allow multiple records for the
  same pair because their identities are separate IDs. (D06, D08, D12–D14)

The File–User link establishes an associated user. The schema and active API do not
establish that this user performed an upload, so the diagram does not assign that
stronger role. (D10)

### Structured content and derived representations

The chat API validates blocks as an ordered list of structured values owned by a
message. The underlying JSONB column has no constraint enforcing that shape or
its type vocabulary; data written outside these API checks can differ. Validated
content can include text and style, nested elements, user/channel identifiers, links, emoji,
image/file descriptors, labels, fields, accessories, and rows. Embedded identifiers
are not foreign keys. Uninterpreted nested content is retained as data, rather than
expanded into speculative entities. A block mentioning a user does not imply a
`UserMention` record; a file descriptor does not imply a `FileAttachment`. (H03)

| Representation | Conceptual meaning and limit | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Thread and reply count | Derived from an anchor and direct parent references within its conversation | A08 |
| Reaction summary | Group reactions by message and emoji; derive user list and count | A22 |
| Conversation member count | Derived from membership records | H01 |
| Latest DM message | A selected message in that conversation, ordered by creation time then ID | H01 |
| User profile | View of user attributes with fallbacks, generated fields, and constants; no independent profile entity | H02 |
| Search match | View of an existing message, author, and conversation; highlighting and generated result IDs do not change message identity | A26–A27 |

The API's message `ts` comes from `message_id`, while `thread_ts` represents a parent
or selected thread anchor. The separate database `Message.ts` is retained as a
stored attribute without assuming these are synchronized. Names and display text
are descriptions or lookup forms, not replacements for identity. (D04, H04)

Attachments echoed by chat operations are transient values, not stored file
attachments. Conversation `creator`, topic author/time, read markers, subscription
flags, sharing flags, and avatar URLs are not evidence of independently maintained
facts: their provenance is qualified in H01–H02 and A08. Named roles, role
assignments, settings, files, file attachments, mentions, and edits have no direct
access in dispatched Slack handlers or their operations at this revision. Their
foreign keys and ORM cascades still matter: deleting a message cascades to its
edit records, although updating it does not write an edit record.
(D06, D08–D12, D14–D15, H05)

## 4. States and classifications

| Subject | Stored or derived classification | Meaning and qualification | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| User | Stored active and bot flags, each nullable | Active/inactive and bot/non-bot; null is unrecorded. The API supplies fallback values rather than exposing every null distinction. | D01, H02 |
| Workspace membership | Stored role, nullable | `owner`, `admin`, `member`, `guest`; API owner/admin flags derive from this role, not named-role assignments. | D13, H02 |
| Conversation | Stored `is_dm`, `is_gc`, `is_private` | Conventional types are public channel, private channel, DM (`im`), group DM (`mpim`). Keep the flags: no database constraint forbids conflicting combinations, and serializer/filter interpretations differ for such combinations. | D03, H01, A06 |
| Conversation | Stored archived flag | Archived/unarchived; independent of kind. API `is_open` is a derived value or constant, not a separate lifecycle. | D03, H01 |
| Membership | Derived existence | Present/absent; no stored pending-invitation state | D05, D13, A11 |
| Message | Derived parent presence; stored type string? | Parentless/reply; stored type is open-ended, while API message payloads commonly hard-code `message`. | D04, A02, A07–A08 |
| Reaction | Stored emoji name | Database string; API add/remove use `COMMON_REACTIONS` and normalize spelling. The finite API vocabulary does not restrict all possible seeded database values. | D07, A20–A21 |
| User settings | Stored notification level, nullable | `all`, `mentions`, `none`; no dispatched API reads it | D11 |
| Workspace settings | Stored file-upload flag, nullable | True/false/unrecorded; no dispatched API enforces it | D09 |
| Named role / file | Stored role name? / file type? | Open strings, not enumerated role permissions or a validated file taxonomy | D08, D10 |
| Message blocks | Stored type tags, checked at API boundary | Block, rich-text container, and inner-element vocabularies below; validation depth varies | H03 |

The implemented block vocabulary is `rich_text`, `markdown`, `section`, `header`,
`divider`, `image`, `context`, `actions`, `input`, `file`, `video`, `table`, and
`context_actions`. Rich-text containers are `rich_text_section`, `rich_text_list`,
`rich_text_preformatted`, and `rich_text_quote`. Inner-element tags are `text`,
`emoji`, `link`, `user`, `usergroup`, `channel`, `broadcast`, `color`, and `date`.
Accepted tags do not imply separate operational capabilities such as user-group
management or video handling. Text generation interprets only part of this vocabulary.
It also distinguishes `plain_text` from `mrkdwn` section text, ordered from other
list styles, and bold/italic/strike/code text styles; these remain content attributes.

`UserPresence` declares `active` and `away` in the source but is neither mapped to a
column nor used by dispatched handlers. It therefore adds no presence state to
this model. State transitions and validation limits belong in the behavior model.

#### Step 2
Reasoning: Let me think about this task. What the user is asking for is:
1. Identify the workspace owner (probably the workspace's owner, or the Slack workspace's owner?)
2. Find the channels that this owner belongs to
3. Among those, the ones created before March 2026
4. Among those, the ones with exactly 5 members
5. Archive such a channel (probably there should be one and only one)
6. If none exist, tell them so

"workspace owner" — probably the Slack workspace's owner. Hmm, or does it mean the "workspace owner" of OpenClaw? No — in the context of Slack, "our workspace owner" probably means the owner of the Slack workspace. Let me first check authentication with auth.test to confirm who I am, then figure out who the workspace owner is.

Slack API: users.list has the "is_owner" field on each user. So the workspace owner is a user with is_owner: true.

Next, I need to find the channels that the owner belongs to. But I'm authenticated as some user (probably not the owner). conversations.list with the types public_channel,private_channel specified lists channels that I (the calling user) belong to. But the owner might be a member of channels I'm not in. Hmm.

users.conversations with the user parameter specified: "Browse conversations by a specific user ID's membership." So I can list the owner's conversations with users.conversations user=<owner_id>. This works if the token has the appropriate scopes (like channels:read or groups:read, etc.).

After that, for each channel: get info with
Command: curl -s -X POST https://slack.com/api/auth.test -d 'token=<TOKEN>' | python3 -m json.tool
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\n    \"ok\": true,\n    \"url\": \"https://T1.slack.com/\",\n    \"team\": \"Workspace T1\",\n    \"user\": \"AgentBot\",\n    \"team_id\": \"T1\",\n    \"user_id\": \"U01AGENBOT9\",\n    \"bot_id\": \"B01AGENBOT9\"\n}"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: Alright. Next I need to find the workspace owner. Workspace owner = user with is_owner=true in the users.list response.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://slack.com/api/users.list -d 'token=<TOKEN>&limit=1000' | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
print('ok:',d['ok'])
for u in d['members']:
    print(u['id'], u.get('deleted'), u.get('is_admin'), u.get('is_owner'), repr(u['profile'].get('real_name')))
"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "ok: True\nU01AGENBOT9 False True False 'Agent Bot'\nU_AISHA False False False 'Aisha Khan'\nU_AMARA False True False 'Amara Diallo'\nU_DIEGO False False False 'Diego Alvarez'\nU_ELENA False False False 'Elena Petrova'\nU_LEO False False False 'Leo Park'\nU_MAYA False False False 'Maya Chen'\nU_NINA False False False 'Nina Osei'\nU_OMAR False False False 'Omar Haddad'\nU_PRIYA False False False 'Priya Sharma'\nU_SAM False False False 'Sam Coleman'\nU_TARIQ False False False 'Tariq Malik'\nU_VICTOR False True True 'Victor Reyes'"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: The workspace owner is U_VICTOR (is_owner=True). Next, list the channels that Victor is a member of (users.conversations with user=U_VICTOR), including public channels and private channels. After that, filter by ones created before March 2026 and with exactly 5 members.

Workspace owner is Victor Reyes (U_VICTOR). Now let me find his channels:
Command: curl -s -X POST https://slack.com/api/users.conversations -d 'token=<TOKEN>&user=U_VICTOR&types=public_channel,private_channel&exclude_archived=true&limit=999' | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
print('ok:',d['ok'])
for c in d['channels']:
    import datetime
    created = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(c['created']).isoformat()
    print(c['id'], c.get('name'), 'created:', created, 'is_private:', c.get('is_private'), 'is_archived:', c.get('is_archived'))

Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "ok: True\nC_LATE proj-orion created: 2026-03-04T17:00:00 is_private: False is_archived: False"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: Victor belongs to one public channel, proj-orion, and it was created on March 4, 2026 — after March 2026. Also, there might be private channels that aren't visible to me. The call returned only one channel. Hmm, users.conversations with the user parameter lists the conversations that user is a member of (that I'm authorized to see). The result is just proj-orion.

But wait — "created before March 2026" — proj-orion was created on 2026-03-04, which is in March 2026, not before it. So it doesn't qualify.

Just to be safe, let me double-check with conversations.list whether there are any other channels where Victor is a member. The default types for conversations.list is public_channel. Let me try listing all public and private channels and cross-checking member membership.

Only one channel found via that call, and it was created March 4, 2026 — after the cutoff. Let me cross-check against the full channel list to make sure I'm not missing any (including private channels):
Command: curl -s -X POST https://slack.com/api/conversations.list -d 'token=<TOKEN>&types=public_channel,private_channel&limit=1000' | python3 -c "
import json,sys,datetime
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
print('ok:',d['ok'])
for c in d['channels']:
    created = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(c['created']).isoformat()
    print(c['id'], c.get('name'), 'created:', created, 'private:', c.get('is_private'), 'archived:', c.get('is_archived'), 'is_ext_shared:', c.get('is_shared'))
"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "ok: True\nC_GENERAL general created: 2026-04-01T16:00:00 private: False archived: False is_ext_shared: False\nC_LATE proj-orion created: 2026-03-04T17:00:00 private: False archived: False is_ext_shared: False\nC_RANDOM watercooler created: 2026-01-01T17:00:00 private: False archived: False is_ext_shared: False"}

#### Step 6
Reasoning: Interesting. conversations.list (with my bot token) shows 3 channels: general, proj-orion, watercooler. But users.conversations for Victor only shows proj-orion. Wait — that's strange. Victor should be a member of channels he belongs to. Let me re-verify. Actually, users.conversations returned only proj-orion for Victor. Hmm, but maybe Victor is a member of more channels and it's a pagination issue? No, there's no cursor. Let me check the members of each channel to confirm who is in which channel, and check whether Victor is a member of general/watercooler.

Wait — actually, the result of users.conversations with user=U_VICTOR was only proj-orion. But maybe that endpoint only returns channels that both the calling user (AgentBot) and the target user share? No, actually, per the docs, users.conversations with a user parameter lists the conversations of the specified user. However, bot tokens have limited visibility. In any case, let me check each channel's members and see who's in what, and whether Victor is included.

I found that `users.conversations` shows only proj-orion for Victor, but the full list has 3 channels, so I'll verify membership directly to confirm which ones he's actually in.
Command: for ch in C_GENERAL C_LATE C_RANDOM; do
echo "=== $ch ==="
curl -s -X POST https://slack.com/api/conversations.members -d "token=<TOKEN>&channel=$ch&limit=100" | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
print('ok:',d['ok'],'count:',len(d['members']))
for m in d['members']: print(' ',m)
"
done
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "=== C_GENERAL ===\nok: True count: 6\n  U01AGENBOT9\n  U_AMARA\n  U_ELENA\n  U_SAM\n  U_TARIQ\n  U_NINA\n=== C_LATE ===\nok: True count: 5\n  U01AGENBOT9\n  U_VICTOR\n  U_NINA\n  U_SAM\n  U_TARIQ\n=== C_RANDOM ===\nok: True count: 2\n  U01AGENBOT9\n  U_ELENA"}

#### Step 7
Reasoning: Channels Victor belongs to:
- proj-orion (C_LATE): created 2026-03-04, 5 members — but was it created before March 2026? March 4, 2026 is in March 2026, not before March 2026. The condition is "created before March 2026" — that is, before 2026-03-01. March 4 is not before March. Therefore it fails.
- watercooler (C_RANDOM): 2026-01-01, created before March 2026, but only 2 members, and Victor is not a member.
- general: created in April, 6 members, Victor is not a member.

So, there is no channel that satisfies all three conditions. Following the instructions: I should just tell them as much.

I checked, and there's no channel that fits all three criteria:

- **Victor Reyes** (workspace owner) is only a member of **proj-orion**, which has exactly 5 members — but it was created **March 4, 2026**, not *before* March 2026.
- **watercooler** was created January 1, 2026 (before March), but only has 2 members and Victor isn't in it.
- **general** has 6 members, was created in April, and doesn't include Victor.

So nothing qualifies — no channel archived. If "created in or before March 2026" is what you meant, proj-orion would be the one; say the word and I'll archive it.

I checked, and there's no channel that fits all three criteria:

- **watercooler** was created January 1, 2026 (before March), but only has 2 members and Victor isn't in it.
- **general** has 6 members, was created in April, and doesn't include Victor.

So nothing qualifies — no channel archived. If "created in or before March 2026" is what you meant, proj-orion would be the one; say the word and I'll archive it.
