# Reviewing an assistant's work

You review what an AI assistant did for a user in an online service. You get the user's request, every step the
assistant took (its visible reasoning, each command it ran and the response), its final reply, and the changes it made
to the account's data.

Decide one thing: **did the assistant make a mistake?**

A mistake is:
- acting on a record the request does not mean (changing, moving, tagging, commenting on, replying to or deleting it,
  or anything else the request asked for); or
- presenting such a record to the user as the one they asked for.

Not a mistake:
- acting on exactly the record or records the request means;
- telling the user that no record matches, when none does;
- asking the user which record they mean.

Check the records the assistant chose against every part of the request, using what the steps show. Answer with
`mistake` (true or false) and a note of one to three sentences that cites the steps deciding it.


# How Google Calendar's records work

The service's domain model follows. Use it to check whether a record meets the request.

# Calendar conceptual model

## Scope

Implemented AgentDiff replica at `4691d3f076db2cdcccdc840c110aa797fa3196dc`. Extracted manually under the [adopted protocol](../../protocols/conceptual_meta_model.md) and [contextualization](contextualization.md). The implementation is authoritative; local API documentation supports terminology. This is not a model of the entire public service.

Full field declarations, constraints, source hashes and dispatched operations are retained in [source_inventory.json](source_inventory.json). [model.json](model.json) records the reviewed entity/relationship decisions; [the ledger](model_source_ledger.md) records dispositions and the reverse audit. API exposure is a separate qualification: an unexposed domain concept remains in the structural model.

## Vocabulary and entities

| Entity | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|
| User | Local account identity, email and display name, with a keyed setting-value collection. | [schema.py:104](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| Calendar | Scheduling container with an owning local account and presentation settings. | [schema.py:141](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| CalendarListEntry | A user’s inclusion of a calendar in their list, with access role and per-user presentation/preferences. | [schema.py:193](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| Event | Scheduled record, recurring master, or persisted exception; virtual occurrences are derived Event representations. | [schema.py:258](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| EventAttendee | Event-specific participation by an email-addressed person/resource, including RSVP state. Not necessarily a local User. | [schema.py:465](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| EventReminder | Stored event-owned reminder record (method and minutes). Separate from the JSON reminder policy used by API responses. | [schema.py:516](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| AclRule | Calendar access grant to a tagged scope (default, user, group, domain); scope values are not local User foreign keys. | [schema.py:544](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |

## Entity–relationship model

The attributes below retain real implementation names. Reference columns are represented by named relationships in the following table; they are not additional scalar concepts. Structured JSON values remain structured attributes unless the implementation gives them relationship meaning. Stored snapshots/caches are retained even when API writers usually synchronize them.

| Entity | Identity and extra uniqueness | Stored values outside declared FKs |
|---|---|---|
| User | PK `id`; unique `email` | `email`, `display_name`, `self_`, `created_at`, `updated_at` |
| Calendar | PK `id` | `summary`, `description`, `location`, `time_zone`, `etag`, `conference_properties`, `auto_accept_invitations`, `data_owner`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted` |
| CalendarListEntry | PK `id`; see exact composite constraints/indexes in inventory | `etag`, `access_role`, `summary_override`, `description_override`, `color_id`, `background_color`, `foreground_color`, `hidden`, `selected`, `primary`, `deleted`, `default_reminders`, `notification_settings`, `created_at`, `updated_at` |
| Event | PK `id`; see exact composite constraints/indexes in inventory | `etag`, `status`, `html_link`, `summary`, `description`, `location`, `color_id`, `creator_email`, `organizer_email`, `creator_display_name`, `organizer_display_name`, `creator_profile_id`, `organizer_profile_id`, `creator_self`, `organizer_self`, `start`, `end`, `start_datetime`, `end_datetime`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `end_time_unspecified`, `recurrence`, `recurring_event_id`, `original_start_time`, `transparency`, `visibility`, `ical_uid`, `sequence`, `guests_can_invite_others`, `guests_can_modify`, `guests_can_see_other_guests`, `anyone_can_add_self`, `private_copy`, `locked`, `attendees_omitted`, `hangout_link`, `conference_data`, `attachments`, `extended_properties`, `source`, `gadget`, `reminders`, `event_type`, `working_location_properties`, `out_of_office_properties`, `focus_time_properties`, `birthday_properties`, `created_at`, `updated_at` |
| EventAttendee | PK `id`; see exact composite constraints/indexes in inventory | `email`, `display_name`, `organizer`, `self_`, `resource`, `optional`, `response_status`, `comment`, `additional_guests`, `profile_id` |
| EventReminder | PK `id`; see exact composite constraints/indexes in inventory | `method`, `minutes` |
| AclRule | PK `id`; see exact composite constraints/indexes in inventory | `etag`, `role`, `scope_type`, `scope_value`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted` |

Folded values preserve their storage identity and existence:

- **Setting → User**: Unique (user, setting key) values; preserve record id/etag/presence in User.settings. Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `setting_id`, `value`, `etag`.

### Relationships

`Targets/source` means the number of target records for one source record; `sources/target` is the inverse. These are storage-supported cardinalities, not stronger implications of ORM presentation or public API documentation. FK roles are named by their actual source columns. Interpreted references have their subtype/integrity qualifications below.

| Relationship / role | Source → target | Targets/source | Sources/target | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Calendar.owner_id` | Calendar → User | 1 | 0..* | [schema.py:163](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| `CalendarListEntry.user_id` | CalendarListEntry → User | 1 | 0..* | [schema.py:207](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| `CalendarListEntry.calendar_id` | CalendarListEntry → Calendar | 1 | 0..* | [schema.py:210](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| `Event.calendar_id` | Event → Calendar | 1 | 0..* | [schema.py:282](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| `Event.creator_id` | Event → User | 0..1 | 0..* | [schema.py:297](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| `Event.organizer_id` | Event → User | 0..1 | 0..* | [schema.py:300](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| `EventAttendee.event_id` | EventAttendee → Event | 1 | 0..* | [schema.py:479](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |
| `EventReminder.event_id` | EventReminder → Event | 1 | 0..* | [schema.py:526](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py) |

Solid lines mean the referenced identity contributes to the child entity’s key; dashed lines mean it does not. Contracted pair associations are shown as many-to-many links, with their pair keys preserved in the source inventory. This matches Slack’s identifying/non-identifying notation and does not change graph connectivity.

### Representations and qualifications

- **C1: Identity and scope.** Event.id is a global storage primary key, despite calendar-scoped URLs. iCalUID is indexed but not unique. CalendarListEntry has a private storage id and unique (user_id,calendar_id); the response id is calendar_id. EventAttendee has its own storage id and unique (event_id,email). ACL scope uniqueness includes a nullable scope_value and must not be read as strict uniqueness for SQL NULL. Sources: [schema.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py), [serializers.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/core/serializers.py).
- **C2: Local accounts versus person values.** Event creator_id and organizer_id refer to local User records, but the API serializes separately stored email/display/profile/self fields. An imported organizer can disagree with the local organizer FK. Calendar.dataOwner may use a separately stored value, with owner email as a fallback; it does not always reveal owner_id. Preserve these distinctions. Attendee email, ACL scope and conference participant data do not imply local User records. Sources: [operations.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/operations.py), [serializers.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/core/serializers.py).
- **C3: Reminders and settings.** EventReminder is a stored, separately identified event-owned record retained in the full model. API event serialization uses Event.reminders JSON instead; no read/write operation maintains the separate table. User Setting records are folded into keyed User.settings values, retaining id/etag/existence. settings.get can return virtual defaults that settings.list does not enumerate. Sources: [schema.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/schema.py), [serializers.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/core/serializers.py).
- **C4: Recurrence.** A master Event carries recurrence rules; occurrences are derived Event views or stored exceptions linked by recurring_event_id and original_start_time. Instance IDs encode master and occurrence time. Recurrence windows and exception merging are computed views, not extra independent entities. The counting rule excludes the self relationship, so these counts do not exhaust recurring-event identification patterns. Sources: [operations.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/operations.py), [utils.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/core/utils.py).
- **C5: Structured values.** Start/end JSON and denormalized datetime/date columns remain separately represented. Conference data, external attachments, extended properties, source/gadget, guest policy, notification settings and event-type properties are values, not invented managed-file/contact/conference entities. Free/busy intervals are derived from stored events; this helper does not expand recurring masters. Colors are fixed response constants. Sources: [operations.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/operations.py), [serializers.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/core/serializers.py).
- **C6: Actor and access scope.** CalendarList and settings operations are for the current actor; there is no general user-directory/list-other-users-calendars endpoint. Access may derive from list entries, owner or user/domain/default ACL matching; group expansion is not implemented. Access roles and visibility are modeled without assuming every permission/type restriction from the public API is enforced. Sources: [operations.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/operations.py), [methods.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/api/methods.py).
- **C7: Deferred interface state.** Channel and SyncToken tables preserve watch delivery metadata/cursor state. All their fields remain in the source ledger but are deferred to interface/behavior modeling. Watch handlers create registrations; source contains no push delivery service. Batch wraps the same 37 scheduling/interface handlers rather than adding domain objects. Sources: [batch.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/api/batch.py), [operations.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/operations.py).
- **C8: Documentation differences.** Moving an event changes calendar_id without rewriting organizer payload/FK. Public move documentation says organizer changes. Settings defaults and replacement/update semantics must follow handlers, not assume complete public Google Calendar behavior. Creation/update do not copy every stored attendee property. Sources: [operations.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/database/operations.py), [methods.py](../../../backend/src/services/calendar/api/methods.py).

Derived representations do not add independent base-graph entities or duplicate edges:

- Virtual recurrence occurrences, time-zone formatted start/end and merged exception lists.
- Current actor’s primary-calendar alias and per-user calendar list presentation.
- Free/busy intervals, access-role derivation, fixed color palettes and setting defaults.

## States and classifications

Boolean flags, status/type strings, archive/deletion timestamps and structured policy values are attributes of their owning entity. A stored value does not prove a transition, permission check or background service is implemented. The explicit enum declarations are:

| Declaration | Values | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| AccessRole | `none`, `freeBusyReader`, `reader`, `writer`, `owner` | Stored/API vocabulary; use only on the fields whose implementation uses it |
| EventStatus | `confirmed`, `tentative`, `cancelled` | Stored/API vocabulary; use only on the fields whose implementation uses it |
| EventTransparency | `opaque`, `transparent` | Stored/API vocabulary; use only on the fields whose implementation uses it |
| EventVisibility | `default`, `public`, `private`, `confidential` | Stored/API vocabulary; use only on the fields whose implementation uses it |
| EventType | `default`, `outOfOffice`, `focusTime`, `workingLocation`, `fromGmail`, `birthday` | Stored/API vocabulary; use only on the fields whose implementation uses it |
| AttendeeResponseStatus | `needsAction`, `declined`, `tentative`, `accepted` | Stored/API vocabulary; use only on the fields whose implementation uses it |
| AclScopeType | `default`, `user`, `group`, `domain` | Stored/API vocabulary; use only on the fields whose implementation uses it |
| ReminderMethod | `email`, `popup` | Stored/API vocabulary; use only on the fields whose implementation uses it |

"exit_code": 0, "workspace_path": "/tmp/agent_diff_69c180253ff24514bd36c5b6f235b77c_bdu5sk7i"}

#### Step 2
Reasoning: Looking at the calendar list, I need to find the "Ops Rotation" calendar where the user is the owner and the description (or metadata) mentions weekend on-call coverage.

The candidates are:
1. **Ops Rotation – APAC**: description "Handles daytime shift scheduling for the APAC ops team." - No weekend on-call mention
2. **Ops Rotation – EMEA**: description "Coordinates staffing schedules for the EMEA operations team." with location "Weekend on-call coverage rota posted here every Friday." - This is the one with weekend on-call coverage
3. **Ops Rotation – LATAM**: description "Tracks quarterly maintenance windows for LATAM data centers." - No weekend on-call mention

The EMEA calendar (`ops-emea@northwind.example`) is the match - it's the only Ops Rotation calendar with "weekend on-call coverage" mentioned in its metadata. Now I'll PATCH the calendar to change its timezone to America/New_York.
Command: curl -s -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/ops-emea%40northwind.example" -d '{"timeZone": "America/New_York"}' | python3 -m json.tool
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\n    \"kind\": \"calendar#calendar\",\n    \"etag\": \"\\\"cd4eb284fd4a0e71\\\"\",\n    \"id\": \"ops-emea@northwind.example\",\n    \"summary\": \"Ops Rotation \\u2013 EMEA\",\n    \"description\": \"Coordinates staffing schedules for the EMEA operations team.\",\n    \"location\": \"Weekend on-call coverage rota posted here every Friday.\",\n    \"timeZone\": \"America/New_York\",\n    \"conferenceProperties\": {\n        \"allowedConferenceSolutionTypes\": [\n            \"hangoutsMeet\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"dataOwner\": \"jordan.lee@northwind.example\"\n}\n", "stderr": "", "exit_code": 0, "workspace_path": "/tmp/agent_diff_69c180253ff24514bd36c5b6f235b77c_bdu5sk7i"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: The PATCH request succeeded. The calendar "Ops Rotation – EMEA" (ops-emea@northwind.example) now has its timeZone set to "America/New_York", confirmed by the API response. This was the correct calendar — the user owns it (dataOwner: jordan.lee@northwind.example, accessRole: owner) and its location field mentions "Weekend on-call coverage rota posted here every Friday." The task is complete.


<done>
Changed the time zone of the **Ops Rotation – EMEA** calendar (ops-emea@northwind.example) from America/Los_Angeles to **America/New_York**. This was the correct target — it's the Ops Rotation calendar the user owns whose metadata mentions "Weekend on-call coverage rota posted here every Friday."
</done>
Command:

Changed the time zone of the **Ops Rotation – EMEA** calendar (ops-emea@northwind.example) from America/Los_Angeles to **America/New_York**. This was the correct target — it's the Ops Rotation calendar the user owns whose metadata mentions "Weekend on-call coverage rota posted here every Friday."

## Changes it made to the account's data
