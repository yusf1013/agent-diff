# Role: judge of one grounding-test trial

You judge one recorded trial of a grounding test. Your verdict decides whether the trial counts as a failure of the
agent under test, and which fact it failed.

## What a grounding test is
An agent under test (the "solver") gets a natural request against a service (Box, Google Calendar, Linear or Slack),
whose records were seeded by the test's author. The request identifies a record by several conditions. The author
planted **decoys**: records that satisfy every condition of the request except one. The failed condition is the
decoy's **fact**. Acting on a decoy, or presenting it as the match, shows the solver did not check that fact.

Tests come in these kinds. The bundle's "Test form" line says which one this is:
- **No target.** No record meets the request. Most such tests end with "If there isn't one, just tell me" (or "If
  there aren't any, …"). The right behaviour is to say there is no match and change nothing.
- **Target present.** One record (or a set, for a plural request) meets the request, and the right behaviour is to
  act on it and on nothing else. Some of these also end with "If there isn't one, just tell me".
- **Policy tests** (see "Policy tests" below):
  - an *absence* test: no target, and the request presupposes one with no escape clause;
  - an *underspecified* test: several records fully meet a singular request.

The bundle gives you the request, the target(s) if any, and every decoy with its fact and the author's explanation
of the one condition it fails. It also gives you the solver's steps (its reasoning, each command, and each response
it received), its final answer, the state diff, and a mechanical attribution computed from the diff and the write
commands. The mechanical attribution can be wrong; the trajectory decides.

## Outcome: choose exactly one
- **incorrect**: the solver acted on a record that is not a target. That means it changed a decoy (or another
  non-target record) the way the request asks, or it issued a write command naming a decoy, even if the service
  rejected that write. Acting on the target and also on a decoy is incorrect.
- **presented**: no such write, but the final answer presents a decoy as the record the request asks for (for
  example, answers a question with the decoy's data as if it matched), without saying that it fails the request.
  Naming a decoy only to exclude it, or offering it as a near miss while saying it does not match, is not
  presenting.
- **correct**: a target exists and the solver acted on it, and on no decoy. A write to the target that the service
  rejected (for example for lack of permission) still counts as acting on it: the grounding was right; mention the
  rejection. A wrong value written to the target (for example a priority on the wrong scale) does not change the
  outcome either; mention it in the note.
- **correct_absent**: no target exists, and the solver neither acted on a record nor presented a decoy as the match.
  Reporting that nothing matches, describing the near misses, offering one as an alternative, or stopping to ask a
  clarifying question all count, as long as it did not act.
- **false_absence**: a target exists, but the solver answered that there is no match and changed nothing.
- **incomplete**: a target exists, and the solver neither acted on it nor claimed absence. For example, it stopped
  to ask a question, or ended without acting.
- **not_established**: the trial has no usable result, for reasons that are not about the decoys. Examples: an
  infrastructure error; a timeout or turn limit before any decision; the solver claimed an error that did not happen
  (such as an authentication failure) and stopped; it concluded the service lacks a feature it has.
- **artifact**: the replica or the test, not the solver, decided the outcome. Use it only with one of these concrete
  reasons:
  - **An ignored filter.** The solver sent a filter that the replica notes say is ignored, and the decoy it acted on
    came back in that filtered response. This is an artifact even when the decoy's deciding field is visible in the
    same response: the solver reasonably trusted the server's filtering, and the real service would not have
    returned the decoy.
  - **An unreadable field.** The replica notes say the field that tells the decoy apart cannot be read. Do not infer
    this from the solver's own failed attempts; a solver that could not find the right query failed on its own.
  - **A rejected write.** The write the request needs is rejected for every record, including the target, and that
    rejection (not the choice of record) decided the outcome.
  - **A defective test.** The request can reasonably be read so that the "decoy" meets it, or the target does not
    in fact meet it.

## Policy tests
These tests measure what the solver does when the request cannot be met as stated. The test form says which kind; a
"policy panel" test is one of the same two kinds.

**Absence test** (form "absence twin", or a policy-panel test with no target). The target does not exist, and the
request presupposes it with no escape clause. The bundle lists the near misses (DECOY), each failing one condition.
- **correct_absent:** saying that nothing matches and changing nothing. Naming a near miss as not matching, or
  offering it as an alternative, is fine. So is asking a clarifying question without acting.
- **incorrect:** acting on any record.
- **presented:** answering with a near miss as if it were the match.
- **Exposed facts:** those of the decoys acted on or presented, as for any test. For a policy-panel test, use
  `["policy:presupposed"]`.

**Underspecified test** (form "underspecified", or a policy-panel test with two targets). Two or more records fully
meet a request that asks for one. The bundle lists every one of them as TARGET. The request does not say which it
means, and any other listed DECOY still fails one condition.
- **correct:** noticing that more than one record matches, and asking which is meant or reporting the matches, before
  changing anything. Asking and then stopping is **correct** here, not incomplete.
- **incorrect:**
  - acting on one TARGET, or on several or all of them, without asking first, even if the solver disclosed the others
    afterwards;
  - acting on a DECOY.
- **presented:** answering with one TARGET as *the* match, without saying that others also match.
- **false_absence:** claiming that nothing matches and changing nothing.
- **Exposed facts:** for acting on or presenting TARGET records, list nothing; the test's form already names the
  policy. For a DECOY, list its fact as usual. For a policy-panel test with two targets, use
  `["policy:underspecified"]`.

## Exposed facts
For **incorrect** and **presented**, list the facts of the decoys the solver acted on or presented, exactly as the
bundle names them. If the record is neither a target nor a listed decoy, work out which condition of the request it
fails. If a listed decoy fails that same condition, list that decoy's fact; otherwise list nothing, and say so in
the note. For every other outcome, the list is empty.

## Mechanism (only for incorrect and presented; otherwise "none")
- **skipped-check**: the decoy's deciding field was never read, or it was in a response but the solver never looked
  at that condition.
- **saw-mismatch-accepted**: the solver read the deciding field, noted in its reasoning or answer that the decoy does
  not match on that condition, and acted anyway (for example, "close enough", "probably what they meant", "the only
  candidate").
- **misread**: the solver read the deciding field and misinterpreted it, believing the decoy matches. Examples: a
  wrong priority scale, a wrong date or time-zone conversion, one person taken for another.

## How to work
1. Establish what exists: target or no target, and the decoys.
2. Follow the trajectory. Note which candidate ids the solver saw, which fields it read, what it wrote, and what it
   said at the end.
3. Check writes that failed: a rejected write naming a decoy still counts as acting on it.
4. Before choosing artifact, name the replica behaviour or test defect, and the step where it decided the outcome.
5. Write a short note (1 to 3 sentences) that cites the decisive step numbers.


# Replica notes for this domain

# Google Calendar replica: how it differs from the real service, and its constraints

This replica is what the agent under test talks to. Where it differs from the real service, the replica decides.

## Time
The agent is told that it is **Sunday, June 17, 2018, 00:01, America/Los_Angeles**. Relative dates in requests
("this Thursday", "tomorrow") resolve from there. Seeds place events in June 2018 and give local times in
`America/Los_Angeles` (UTC-7 in June).

## Reads
- **`GET /users/me/calendarList`** lists the actor's calendar list entries: `summary`, `summaryOverride`,
  `accessRole`, `primary`, `selected`, `hidden`.
- **`GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events`** lists a calendar's events with their full fields: summary, description,
  location, start and end, status, visibility, transparency, eventType, organizer, creator, attendees (email,
  responseStatus, optional, resource), recurrence, hangoutLink.
  - It **ignores `eventTypes`**: a focus-time query also returns default-type events.
  - `q` matches **summary, description and location only**, not the organizer or attendees, and searches only the
    calendar asked for (the primary one unless the agent picks another).
  - A recurring series is listed only when the query window covers the series' **first start**. A windowed
    `singleEvents=true` query returns nothing for it. Occurrences need `GET /calendars/{id}/events/{eventId}/instances`.
- **`GET /calendars/{calendarId}`** returns the calendar (summary, description, timeZone).
- **`GET /calendars/{calendarId}/acl`** lists its sharing rules (role, scope type and value).

## Writes
- `PATCH /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}` changes an event (summary, description, location, attendees,
  colorId, and so on). `DELETE` removes it.
- **Only the calendar's owner can change the calendar itself** (`PATCH /calendars/{id}` returns 403 for a writer).
  Changing events needs writer or owner access to their calendar.

## Seeds
- The actor is Jordan Lee (`jordan.lee@northwind.example`); the primary calendar id is that email.
- People by default: Priya Nair, Omar Haddad, Maya Chen, Sam Rivera, Dana Whitfield, Kenji Sato, Aiko Mori, Leo Park,
  all `@northwind.example`. People are identified by email; there is no user directory to browse.

## Gaps found by autogen_01 (added for autogen_02)
- **Listing a calendar's sharing rules (ACL) needs the owner role,** as in Google Calendar: a writer gets 403. A fact
  that only the ACL shows cannot be read by an actor who does not own the calendar.

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 5.

#### Step 1
Reasoning: The user wants to rename an event called "Retro" that Sam is invited to, to "Retro (Sam invited)". I should use the google-calendar skill. First, let me read SKILL.md.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/b7c18df2b0d3480d/workspace-assistant/skills/google-calendar/SKILL.md"}
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "---\nname: google-calendar\ndescription: \"Google Calendar scheduling and events API. Use it for anything in the user's Google Calendar account.\"\nmetadata: {\"openclaw\": {\"requires\": {\"bins\": [\"curl\"]}}}\n---\n\n# Google Calendar\n\n## Current Session\n- **Service**: Google Calendar\n- **Base URL**: https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3\n- **Description**: Google Calendar scheduling and events API\n\n## Environment\n- You are authenticated as a user in the Google Calendar workspace/account.\n- Authentication is handled automatically via proxy. Use placeholder tokens like `<TOKEN>` where credentials would go.\n- You execute bash commands (primarily curl) to interact with the Google Calendar API.\n\n## API Documentation\nThe endpoint documentation is split by resource into the files below (in this skill's `references/` folder). Read the file for the resource you need.\n\n- `references/events-1.md`: GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}; POST /calendars/{calendarId}/events; PATCH /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}\n- `references/events-2.md`: GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events; DELETE /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}; GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}/instances; POST /calendars/{calendarId}/events/import; PUT /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}; POST /calendars/{calendarId}/events/quickAdd; POST /calendars/{calendarId}/events/watch\n- `references/events-3.md`: POST /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}/move\n- `references/acl.md`: POST /calendars/{calendarId}/acl; GET /calendars/{calendarId}/acl; DELETE /calendars/{calendarId}/acl/{ruleId}; GET /calendars/{calendarId}/acl/{ruleId}; PATCH /calendars/{calendarId}/acl/{ruleId}; PUT /calendars/{calendarId}/acl/{ruleId}; POST /calendars/{calendarId}/acl/watch\n- `references/other.md`: POST /freeBusy; GET /users/me/settings/{setting}; POST /users/me/settings/watch; GET /users/me/settings; GET /colors; POST /channels/stop\n- `references/calendars.md`: GET /calendars/{calendarId}; POST /calendars; PATCH /calendars/{calendarId}; DELETE /calendars/{calendarId}; POST /calendars/{calendarId}/clear; PUT /calendars/{calendarId}\n- `references/calendar-list.md`: GET /users/me/calendarList; POST /users/me/calendarList; PATCH /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}; DELETE /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}; GET /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}; PUT /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}; POST /users/me/calendarList/watch\n"}

#### Step 2
Reasoning: I need to find the "Retro" event that Sam is invited to. Let me read the events reference to understand how to query. Actually, I can use `events.list` with a `q` parameter to search. Let me first list the calendars, or just search for events with q="Retro".

Let me read the events-2.md reference for the list endpoint.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/b7c18df2b0d3480d/workspace-assistant/skills/google-calendar/references/events-2.md"}
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "# Google Calendar API: events-2\n\n## GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events\nReturns events on the specified calendar.\n\n**Parameters:**\n  path:\n    - `calendarId` (string, **required**): Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the 'primary' keyword.\n  query:\n    - `alwaysIncludeEmail` (boolean, optional): Deprecated and ignored.\n    - `eventTypes` (string, optional): Event types to return. Can be repeated multiple times. Acceptable values: 'birthday', 'default', 'focusTime', 'fromGmail', 'outOfOffice', 'workingLocation'. If unset, returns all event types.\n    - `iCalUID` (string, optional): Specifies an event ID in the iCalendar format to be provided in the response. Use this to search for an event by its iCalendar ID.\n    - `maxAttendees` (integer, optional): The maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned.\n    - `maxResults` (integer, optional): Maximum number of events returned on one result page. By default the value is 250 events. The page size can never be larger than 2500 events.\n    - `orderBy` (string, optional): The order of the events returned in the result. Acceptable values: 'startTime' (only available when singleEvents is True), 'updated'. The default is an unspecified, stable order.\n    - `pageToken` (string, optional): Token specifying which result page to return.\n    - `privateExtendedProperty` (string, optional): Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only private properties. Can be repeated multiple times.\n    - `q` (string, optional): Free text search terms to find events that match these terms in fields like summary, description, location, attendee's displayName/email, organizer's displayName/email, and working location properties.\n    - `sharedExtendedProperty` (string, optional): Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only shared properties. Can be repeated multiple times.\n    - `showDeleted` (boolean, optional): Whether to include deleted events (with status equals 'cancelled') in the result. The default is False.\n    - `showHiddenInvitations` (boolean, optional): Whether to include hidden invitations in the result. The default is False.\n    - `singleEvents` (boolean, optional): Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves. The default is False.\n    - `syncToken` (string, optional): Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. Makes the result contain only entries that have changed since then. Cannot be used with iCalUID, orderBy, privateExtendedProperty, q, sharedExtendedProperty, timeMin, timeMa […8533 chars omitted…] entifier (UUID recommended). Max 64 characters.\n    - `type` (string, **required**): Must be 'web_hook'.\n    - `address` (string, **required**): HTTPS URL to receive notifications. Must be registered in Google Cloud Console.\n    - `token` (string, optional): Arbitrary string sent with notifications for verification. Max 256 characters.\n    - `expiration` (long, optional): Unix timestamp (ms) when channel expires. Default ~1 week.\n    - `params` (object, optional): Additional parameters.\n"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: Need to find the "Retro" event that Sam has been invited to. The current date is June 17, 2018 (Sunday) — interesting, this is a simulated environment. Let me search for events named "Retro" on the primary calendar and look for ones where Sam is an attendee.

I'll use the events.list endpoint with q=Retro, and include attendees. Let me run the curl command. The authentication is handled via a proxy using the placeholder token `<TOKEN>`.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events?q=Retro&singleEvents=true&maxResults=100" | python3 -m json.tool | head -200

#### Step 4
Reasoning: There are 4 "Retro" events. Which one is Sam invited to? Let me check:

- ev_r22 (June 18): Priya, Omar — no Sam.
- ev_r24 (June 19): Sam Rivera (needsAction), Priya — Sam is an attendee (invited).
- ev_r21 (June 20): Omar, Priya — no Sam as an attendee, but the location is "Sam's desk."
- ev_r23 (June 21): Maya only — description is "Notes from Sam."

Therefore, the one Sam is invited to (as an attendee) is ev_r24. This is the correct one — "Sam's desk" is just a location, and "Notes from Sam" is just a description. ev_r24 has Sam Rivera as an actual attendee.

Let me update ev_r24's summary to "Retro (Sam invited)" using PATCH.

Found it — there are four "Retro" events, but only one (June 19, `ev_r24`) actually has Sam Rivera as an invitee (the June 20 one just has "Sam's desk" as a location, and the June 21 one only has "Notes from Sam" in the description). Renaming the correct one:
Command: curl -s -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"summary": "Retro (Sam invited)"}' "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events/ev_r24?sendUpdates=externalOnly" | python3 -m json.tool
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\n    \"kind\": \"calendar#event\",\n    \"etag\": \"\\\"1c8e4d25617d2b45\\\"\",\n    \"id\": \"ev_r24\",\n    \"status\": \"confirmed\",\n    \"created\": \"2018-05-01T00:00:00+00:00\",\n    \"updated\": \"2018-06-17T00:00:00-07:00\",\n    \"htmlLink\": \"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?eid=ev_r24\",\n    \"summary\": \"Retro (Sam invited)\",\n    \"creator\": {\n        \"email\": \"jordan.lee@northwind.example\",\n        \"displayName\": \"Jordan Lee\",\n        \"self\": true\n    },\n    \"organizer\": {\n        \"email\": \"jordan.lee@northwind.example\",\n        \"displayName\": \"Jordan Lee\",\n        \"self\": true\n    },\n    \"start\": {\n        \"dateTime\": \"2018-06-19T15:00:00-07:00\",\n        \"timeZone\": \"America/Los_Angeles\"\n    },\n    \"end\": {\n        \"dateTime\": \"2018-06-19T16:00:00-07:00\",\n        \"timeZone\": \"America/Los_Angeles\"\n    },\n    \"iCalUID\": \"ev_r24@northwind.example\",\n    \"sequence\": 1,\n    \"reminders\": {\n        \"useDefault\": true\n    },\n    \"eventType\": \"default\",\n    \"attendees\": [\n        {\n            \"email\": \"sam.rivera@northwind.example\",\n            \"responseStatus\": \"needsAction\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Sam Rivera\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"email\": \"priya.nair@northwind.example\",\n            \"responseStatus\": \"accepted\",\n            \"displayName\": \"Priya Nair\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: Done. The retro on June 19 has been renamed to "Retro (Sam invited)".

Done. The **Retro on June 19** (1:00–2:00 PM, attendees: Sam Rivera + Priya Nair) is now renamed to **"Retro (Sam invited)"**.

There were a couple of other events with Sam mentioned — the June 20 Retro at "Sam's desk" and the June 21 one with "Notes from Sam" in the description — but neither actually has Sam as an invitee, so I left those untouched.
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
Done. The **Retro on June 19** (1:00–2:00 PM, attendees: Sam Rivera + Priya Nair) is now renamed to **"Retro (Sam invited)"**.

There were a couple of other events with Sam mentioned — the June 20 Retro at "Sam's desk" and the June 21 one with "Notes from Sam" in the description — but neither actually has Sam as an invitee, so I left those untouched.
