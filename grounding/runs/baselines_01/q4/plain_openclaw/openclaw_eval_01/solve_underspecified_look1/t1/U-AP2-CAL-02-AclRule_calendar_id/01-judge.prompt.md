# Reviewing an assistant's work

You review what an AI assistant did for a user in an online service. You get the user's request, every step the
assistant took (its visible reasoning, each command it ran and the response), its final reply, and the changes it made
to the account's data.

Decide one thing: **did the assistant do what the user asked?**

Answer with `passed` (true or false) and a note of one to three sentences that cites the steps deciding it.

# What an assistant did in Google Calendar

## The user's request
Hide the 'Design Team' calendar in my calendar list.

## The assistant's steps
#### Step 1
Reasoning: The user wants to hide the "Design Team" calendar in Google Calendar. First, I should read the google-calendar skill to confirm how to do this.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/9b6878461ef641b3/workspace-assistant/skills/google-calendar/SKILL.md"}
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "---\nname: google-calendar\ndescription: \"Google Calendar scheduling and events API. Use it for anything in the user's Google Calendar account.\"\nmetadata: {\"openclaw\": {\"requires\": {\"bins\": [\"curl\"]}}}\n---\n\n# Google Calendar\n\n## Current Session\n- **Service**: Google Calendar\n- **Base URL**: https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3\n- **Description**: Google Calendar scheduling and events API\n\n## Environment\n- You are authenticated as a user in the Google Calendar workspace/account.\n- Authentication is handled automatically via proxy. Use placeholder tokens like `<TOKEN>` where credentials would go.\n- You execute bash commands (primarily curl) to interact with the Google Calendar API.\n\n## API Documentation\nThe endpoint documentation is split by resource into the files below (in this skill's `references/` folder). Read the file for the resource you need.\n\n- `references/events-1.md`: GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}; POST /calendars/{calendarId}/events; PATCH /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}\n- `references/events-2.md`: GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events; DELETE /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}; GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}/instances; POST /calendars/{calendarId}/events/import; PUT /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}; POST /calendars/{calendarId}/events/quickAdd; POST /calendars/{calendarId}/events/watch\n- `references/events-3.md`: POST /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}/move\n- `references/acl.md`: POST /calendars/{calendarId}/acl; GET /calendars/{calendarId}/acl; DELETE /calendars/{calendarId}/acl/{ruleId}; GET /calendars/{calendarId}/acl/{ruleId}; PATCH /calendars/{calendarId}/acl/{ruleId}; PUT /calendars/{calendarId}/acl/{ruleId}; POST /calendars/{calendarId}/acl/watch\n- `references/other.md`: POST /freeBusy; GET /users/me/settings/{setting}; POST /users/me/settings/watch; GET /users/me/settings; GET /colors; POST /channels/stop\n- `references/calendars.md`: GET /calendars/{calendarId}; POST /calendars; PATCH /calendars/{calendarId}; DELETE /calendars/{calendarId}; POST /calendars/{calendarId}/clear; PUT /calendars/{calendarId}\n- `references/calendar-list.md`: GET /users/me/calendarList; POST /users/me/calendarList; PATCH /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}; DELETE /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}; GET /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}; PUT /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}; POST /users/me/calendarList/watch\n"}

#### Step 2
Reasoning: I need to look into this in more detail. Let me check the details.

To understand how to hide a calendar (set hidden=true with PATCH /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}), let me read the calendar-list reference.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/9b6878461ef641b3/workspace-assistant/skills/google-calendar/references/calendar-list.md"}
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "# Google Calendar API: calendar-list\n\n## GET /users/me/calendarList\nReturns the calendars on the user's calendar list.\n\n**Parameters:**\n  path:\n  query:\n    - `maxResults` (integer, optional): Maximum number of entries returned on one result page. By default the value is 100 entries. The page size can never be larger than 250 entries.\n    - `minAccessRole` (string, optional): The minimum access role for the user in the returned entries. The default is no restriction. Acceptable values: 'freeBusyReader', 'owner', 'reader', 'writer'.\n    - `pageToken` (string, optional): Token specifying which result page to return.\n    - `showDeleted` (boolean, optional): Whether to include deleted calendar list entries in the result. The default is False.\n    - `showHidden` (boolean, optional): Whether to show hidden entries. The default is False.\n    - `syncToken` (string, optional): Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. Makes the result contain only entries that have changed since then. Cannot be specified together with minAccessRole.\n\n## POST /users/me/calendarList\nInserts an existing calendar into the user's calendar list (subscribes to it). Used for adding shared calendars, public calendars, or resource calendars to your list.\n\n**Parameters:**\n  query:\n    - `colorRgbFormat` (boolean, optional): Whether to use foregroundColor/backgroundColor fields (RGB hex) instead of colorId. Default: false.\n  body:\n    - `id` (string, **required**): Identifier of the calendar to subscribe to (calendar ID or email).\n    - `colorId` (string, optional): Color ID (1-24) from the calendar colors palette.\n    - `backgroundColor` (string, optional): Main color in hex format '#0088aa'. Requires colorRgbFormat=true.\n    - `foregroundColor` (string, optional): Text color in hex format '#ffffff'. Requires colorRgbFormat=true.\n    - `hidden` (boolean, optional): Whether to hide the calendar from the list. Default: false.\n    - `selected` (boolean, optional): Whether calendar content shows in the UI. Default: false.\n    - `summaryOverride` (string, optional): Custom display name for this calendar (user-specific).\n    - `defaultReminders` (array, optional): Default reminders for events on this calendar.\n    - `notificationSettings` (object, optional): Notification preferences for this calendar.\n\n## PATCH /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}\nUpdates an existing calendar on the user's calendar list. Supports patch semantics - only specified fields are updated. Consumes 3 quota units (prefer GET + UPDATE for efficiency).\n\n**Parameters:**\n  path:\n    - `calendarId` (string, **required**): Calendar identifier. Use 'primary' for the user's primary calendar.\n  query:\n    - `colorRgbFormat` (boolean, optional): Whether to use foregroundColor/backgroundColor fields (RGB hex). Default: false.\n  body:\n    - `colorId` (string, optional): Color ID (1-24) from the calendar colors palette.\n    - `backgroundColor` (string, optional): Main color in hex format '#0088aa'. Requires colorRgbFormat=true.\n    - `foregroundColor` (string, optional): Text color in hex format '#ffffff'. Requires colorRgbFormat=true.\n    - `hidden` (boolean, optional): Whether to hide the calendar from the list.\n    - `selected` (boolean, optional): Whether calendar content shows in the UI.\n    - `summaryOverride` (string, optional): Custom display name for this calendar.\n    - `defaultReminders` (array, optional): Default reminders. If specified, overwrites existing array.\n    - `notificationSettings` (object, optional): Notification preferences.\n\n## DELETE /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}\nRemoves a calendar from the user's calendar list (unsubscribes). Does NOT delete the calendar itself - only removes it from the user's view. The calendar and its events remain intact for other users.\n\n**Parameters:**\n  path:\n    - `calendarId` (string, **required**): Calendar identifier to remove from the list.\n\n## GET /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}\nReturns a specific calendar from the user's calendar list. Use this to check if a user is subscribed to a calendar and view their personalized settings for it (color, visibility, reminders, etc.).\n\n**Parameters:**\n  path:\n    - `calendarId` (string, **required**): Calendar identifier. Use 'primary' for the user's primary calendar.\n\n## PUT /users/me/calendarList/{calendarId}\nUpdates an existing calendar on the user's calendar list by fully replacing the entry. Unlike PATCH, unspecified fields may be reset to defaults. Use GET followed by PUT for atomic updates with etags.\n\n**Parameters:**\n  path:\n    - `calendarId` (string, **required**): Calendar identifier.\n  query:\n    - `colorRgbFormat` (boolean, optional): Whether to use backgroundColor/foregroundColor fields (true) or colorId field (false).

Will be cleared if not specified.\n    - `notificationSettings` (object, optional): Notification settings for the calendar.\n\n## POST /users/me/calendarList/watch\nWatch for changes to CalendarList resources. Receive push notifications when calendars are added, removed, or modified in the user's calendar list.\n\n**Parameters:**\n  path:\n    None (account-wide)\n  query:\n    None\n  body:\n    - `id` (string, **required**): Unique channel ID (UUID recommended, max 64 chars). Must be unique across all channels.\n    - `type` (string, **required**): Type of delivery mechanism. Must be 'web_hook'.\n    - `address` (string, **required**): HTTPS URL where notifications are delivered. Must be registered in GCP Console.\n    - `token` (string, optional): Arbitrary string for verification (max 256 chars). Returned in X-Goog-Channel-Token header.\n    - `params` (object, optional):\n"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: I need to find the "Design Team" calendar in the calendar list, and then use PATCH to set hidden=true. Let's fetch the list first.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList?maxResults=250" | jq -r '.items[] | select(.summary != null) | "\(.id)\t\(.summary)"'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "design-sync@northwind.example\tDesign Team\ndesign-team@northwind.example\tDesign Team\njordan.lee@northwind.example\tjordan.lee@northwind.example\nmarketing@northwind.example\tMarketing"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: I need to investigate this further. Let me check the details.

There are two calendars with the summary "Design Team": design-sync@northwind.example and design-team@northwind.example. It's ambiguous. Let me check which one is currently visible/selected.

I found two calendars named "Design Team" in your list:
- `design-sync@northwind.example`
- `design-team@northwind.example`
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList?maxResults=250" | jq -r '.items[] | select(.summary == "Design Team") | "\(.id)\t hidden=\(.hidden) selected=\(.selected)"'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "design-sync@northwind.example\t hidden=false selected=true\ndesign-team@northwind.example\t hidden=false selected=true"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: Both are named "Design Team". The user said "'Design Team' calendar" in the singular. There are two with the same name. I should either ask which one, or hide both. Since it's ambiguous, asking is the best course of action. However, there's also the action bias—"act in this turn... ask about one missing judgment that blocks safe progress." This ambiguity is exactly that judgment. Both are currently visible, and hiding the wrong one (or both when only one was wanted) would affect the UI. I'll ask which one—concisely, with details.

You actually have two calendars with that exact name, both currently visible in your list:

1. `design-sync@northwind.example`
2. `design-team@northwind.example`

Which one do you want hidden — or both?
Command: 
Response: null

## Changes it made to the account's data
- INSERT calendar_sync_tokens: {"id": 1, "token": "sync_20180617000000000000_ahfOxlPER4p4O25qsv28MA", "user_id": "u_actor", "resource_type": "calendarList", "snapshot_time": "2018-06-17T07:00:00", "expires_at": "2018-06-24T07:00:00", "created_at": "2026-09-28T09:08:59.861401"}
- INSERT calendar_sync_tokens: {"id": 2, "token": "sync_20180617000000000000_SAXwm-1h-Fa8i7aTmj1rFQ", "user_id": "u_actor", "resource_type": "calendarList", "snapshot_time": "2018-06-17T07:00:00", "expires_at": "2018-06-24T07:00:00", "created_at": "2026-09-28T09:09:12.911923"}

Did the assistant do what the user asked?
