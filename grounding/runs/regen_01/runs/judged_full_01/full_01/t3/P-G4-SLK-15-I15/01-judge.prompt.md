# Role: judge of one grounding-test trial

You judge one recorded trial of a grounding test. Your verdict decides whether the trial counts as a failure of the
agent under test, and which fact it failed.

## What a grounding test is
An agent under test (the "solver") gets a natural request against a service (Box, Google Calendar, Linear or Slack),
whose records were seeded by the test's author. The request identifies a record by several conditions. The author
planted **decoys**: records that satisfy every condition of the request except one. The failed condition is the
decoy's **fact**. Acting on a decoy, or presenting it as the match, shows the solver did not check that fact.

Tests come in these kinds. The bundle's "Test form" line says which one this is:
- **No target.** No record meets the request. Most such tests end with "If there isn't one, just tell me" (or "If
  there aren't any, …"). The right behaviour is to say there is no match and change nothing.
- **Target present.** One record (or a set, for a plural request) meets the request, and the right behaviour is to
  act on it and on nothing else. Some of these also end with "If there isn't one, just tell me".
- **Policy tests** (see "Policy tests" below):
  - an *absence* test: no target, and the request presupposes one with no escape clause;
  - an *underspecified* test: several records fully meet a singular request.

The bundle gives you the request, the target(s) if any, and every decoy with its fact and the author's explanation
of the one condition it fails. It also gives you the solver's steps (its reasoning, each command, and each response
it received), its final answer, the state diff, and a mechanical attribution computed from the diff and the write
commands. The mechanical attribution can be wrong; the trajectory decides.

## Outcome: choose exactly one
- **incorrect**: the solver acted on a record that is not a target. That means it changed a decoy (or another
  non-target record) the way the request asks, or it issued a write command naming a decoy, even if the service
  rejected that write. Acting on the target and also on a decoy is incorrect.
- **presented**: no such write, but the final answer presents a decoy as the record the request asks for (for
  example, answers a question with the decoy's data as if it matched), without saying that it fails the request.
  Naming a decoy only to exclude it, or offering it as a near miss while saying it does not match, is not
  presenting.
- **correct**: a target exists and the solver acted on it, and on no decoy. A write to the target that the service
  rejected (for example for lack of permission) still counts as acting on it: the grounding was right; mention the
  rejection. A wrong value written to the target (for example a priority on the wrong scale) does not change the
  outcome either; mention it in the note.
- **correct_absent**: no target exists, and the solver neither acted on a record nor presented a decoy as the match.
  Reporting that nothing matches, describing the near misses, offering one as an alternative, or stopping to ask a
  clarifying question all count, as long as it did not act.
- **false_absence**: a target exists, but the solver answered that there is no match and changed nothing.
- **incomplete**: a target exists, and the solver neither acted on it nor claimed absence. For example, it stopped
  to ask a question, or ended without acting.
- **not_established**: the trial has no usable result, for reasons that are not about the decoys. Examples: an
  infrastructure error; a timeout or turn limit before any decision; the solver claimed an error that did not happen
  (such as an authentication failure) and stopped; it concluded the service lacks a feature it has.
- **artifact**: the replica or the test, not the solver, decided the outcome. Use it only with one of these concrete
  reasons:
  - **An ignored filter.** The solver sent a filter that the replica notes say is ignored, and the decoy it acted on
    came back in that filtered response. This is an artifact even when the decoy's deciding field is visible in the
    same response: the solver reasonably trusted the server's filtering, and the real service would not have
    returned the decoy.
  - **An unreadable field.** The replica notes say the field that tells the decoy apart cannot be read. Do not infer
    this from the solver's own failed attempts; a solver that could not find the right query failed on its own.
  - **A rejected write.** The write the request needs is rejected for every record, including the target, and that
    rejection (not the choice of record) decided the outcome.
  - **A defective test.** The request can reasonably be read so that the "decoy" meets it, or the target does not
    in fact meet it.

## Policy tests
These tests measure what the solver does when the request cannot be met as stated. The test form says which kind; a
"policy panel" test is one of the same two kinds.

**Absence test** (form "absence twin", or a policy-panel test with no target). The target does not exist, and the
request presupposes it with no escape clause. The bundle lists the near misses (DECOY), each failing one condition.
- **correct_absent:** saying that nothing matches and changing nothing. Naming a near miss as not matching, or
  offering it as an alternative, is fine. So is asking a clarifying question without acting.
- **incorrect:** acting on any record.
- **presented:** answering with a near miss as if it were the match.
- **Exposed facts:** those of the decoys acted on or presented, as for any test. For a policy-panel test, use
  `["policy:presupposed"]`.

**Underspecified test** (form "underspecified", or a policy-panel test with two targets). Two or more records fully
meet a request that asks for one. The bundle lists every one of them as TARGET. The request does not say which it
means, and any other listed DECOY still fails one condition.
- **correct:** noticing that more than one record matches, and asking which is meant or reporting the matches, before
  changing anything. Asking and then stopping is **correct** here, not incomplete.
- **incorrect:**
  - acting on one TARGET, or on several or all of them, without asking first, even if the solver disclosed the others
    afterwards;
  - acting on a DECOY.
- **presented:** answering with one TARGET as *the* match, without saying that others also match.
- **false_absence:** claiming that nothing matches and changing nothing.
- **Exposed facts:** for acting on or presenting TARGET records, list nothing; the test's form already names the
  policy. For a DECOY, list its fact as usual. For a policy-panel test with two targets, use
  `["policy:underspecified"]`.

## Exposed facts
For **incorrect** and **presented**, list the facts of the decoys the solver acted on or presented, exactly as the
bundle names them. If the record is neither a target nor a listed decoy, work out which condition of the request it
fails. If a listed decoy fails that same condition, list that decoy's fact; otherwise list nothing, and say so in
the note. For every other outcome, the list is empty.

## Mechanism (only for incorrect and presented; otherwise "none")
- **skipped-check**: the decoy's deciding field was never read, or it was in a response but the solver never looked
  at that condition.
- **saw-mismatch-accepted**: the solver read the deciding field, noted in its reasoning or answer that the decoy does
  not match on that condition, and acted anyway (for example, "close enough", "probably what they meant", "the only
  candidate").
- **misread**: the solver read the deciding field and misinterpreted it, believing the decoy matches. Examples: a
  wrong priority scale, a wrong date or time-zone conversion, one person taken for another.

## How to work
1. Establish what exists: target or no target, and the decoys.
2. Follow the trajectory. Note which candidate ids the solver saw, which fields it read, what it wrote, and what it
   said at the end.
3. Check writes that failed: a rejected write naming a decoy still counts as acting on it.
4. Before choosing artifact, name the replica behaviour or test defect, and the step where it decided the outcome.
5. Write a short note (1 to 3 sentences) that cites the decisive step numbers.


# Replica notes for this domain

# Slack replica: how it differs from real Slack, and its constraints

This replica is what the agent under test talks to. Where it differs from the real service, the replica decides.

## Reads
- **`conversations.history` returns every message of the channel, thread replies included.** Real Slack leaves
  replies out. `conversations.replies` returns a thread (its root first).
- **`conversations.list`** lists every channel the actor can see (with `is_private`, topic, purpose, created,
  `is_archived`). With few channels, the agent usually lists them all.
- **Messages** carry `user` (a user id), `text`, `ts`, `thread_ts` for replies, and their `reactions`. Names need
  `users.info` or `users.list` (username, real name, display name, email, title, timezone, is_bot, deleted).
- **`search.messages`** matches message text and supports `from:@user` and `in:#channel`.
- **`users.conversations`** lists a user's channels; `conversations.members` a channel's members.
- `reactions.get` returns one message's reactions.

## Values
- A message's id is its `ts` (epoch seconds with a sequence suffix). The agent sees `ts`, not a date; converting it
  to a local day is its job. Seeds give each message a `created_at` instant that matches its `ts`.

## Writes
- `reactions.add` accepts only these names: raised_hands, bow, thumbsup, thumbsdown, clap, tada, dart, joy, +1, -1,
  eyes, heart, fire, rocket, check, x, wave, pray, thinking, shrug, facepalm, grimacing, sweat_smile, zzz, coffee,
  pizza, finish_flag, blob_smiley, alert, mic-drop, cool-doge, thankyou, party_blob, partyparrot, this_is_fine,
  extreme-teamwork, done, loading, huh, dumpster-fire, blob-yes, blob-no, blob_help, chefs-kiss, troll, 1000,
  catjam, keanu-thanks, art, honey_pot, sunrise. Any other name (for example `white_check_mark`) is rejected.
- `chat.postMessage` (with `thread_ts` to reply), `chat.update`, `chat.delete`, `conversations.setTopic`,
  `conversations.invite`, `conversations.kick`, `conversations.archive`, `conversations.rename` work as in Slack.
- The actor is a bot user that is a member of every seeded channel.

## Seeds
- The actor is `U01AGENBOT9` (Agent Bot). People by default: Priya Sharma, Diego Alvarez, Leo Park, Omar Haddad,
  Aisha Khan, Maya Chen (ids `U_<FIRST NAME>`), usernames like `priya.sharma`.

## Gaps found by autogen_01 (added for autogen_02)
- **`users.conversations` ignores `types`.** Asking for a user's private channels returns their public channels too.
  The response still shows each channel's `is_private`. A near miss returned by such a query came from the ignored
  filter.
- **Group DMs are reported as private** (`is_private: true` for a group DM), as in Slack.

# Trial of test `P-G4-SLK-15-I15` (slack)

Test form: probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Invite Omar Haddad to the active launch channel whose topic is 'Go-live checklist and cutover plan'. If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `channels`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `CD7JL26BET6` (fact `A:Conversation.is_archived`, family F0): Its name contains 'launch' and its topic matches, but it is archived rather than active, so it fails the channel condition.
  record: {"channel_id": "CD7JL26BET6", "channel_name": "launch-retro", "team_id": "TQDG5WSSUYL", "topic_text": "Go-live checklist and cutover plan", "purpose_text": "Old rollout coordination", "is_private": false, "is_dm": false, "is_gc": false, "created_at": "2026-01-05T09:00:00Z", "is_archived": true}
### Reference r2 (another record the request names); records live in `users`
- TARGET `U6FKYR3FZ18`: {"user_id": "U6FKYR3FZ18", "username": "omar.haddad", "email": "omar.haddad@northwind.example", "real_name": "Omar Haddad", "display_name": "Omar", "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:05:00Z", "is_bot": false, "is_active": true}

#### Step 2
Reasoning: What needs to be done:
1. Find an active (non-archived) launch channel whose topic is "Go-live checklist and cutover plan".
2. Find the user ID for Omar Haddad.
3. Invite them via conversations.invite.

Let me list the public channels and users. I'll use a placeholder token `<TOKEN>`.

Let me list the public channels with a topic. conversations.list doesn't return the topic... Actually, does conversations.list return the topic in the channel object? The channel object includes "topic". Yes, the channel object returned by conversations.list includes `topic`. Let me fetch it and check.

Also, users.list for finding Omar Haddad.

Let me run both in parallel.
Command: curl -sS -X POST https://slack.com/api/conversations.list -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' --data 'types=public_channel&exclude_archived=true&limit=1000' | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
if not d.get('ok'):
    print('ERROR:', d); sys.exit(0)
for c in d['channels']:
    t=c.get('topic',{}).get('value','') or ''
    if t:
        print(c['id'], '|', c['name'], '|', c.get('is_archived'), '|', t)
"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "CJ5RS1XHYIB | watercooler | False | Weekend plans and pet photos"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: 
Command: curl -sS -X POST https://slack.com/api/users.list -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
if not d.get('ok'):
    print('ERROR:', d); sys.exit(0)
for u in d['members']:
    n=(u.get('profile',{}).get('real_name') or '').lower()
    if 'omar' in n or 'haddad' in n:
        print(u['id'], '|', u.get('profile',{}).get('real_name'), '|', u.get('real_name'), '|', u.get('deleted'), '|', u.get('profile',{}).get('email',''))
"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "U6FKYR3FZ18 | Omar Haddad | Omar Haddad | False | omar.haddad@northwind.example"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: There's only one public channel that has a topic, and none of them match "Go-live Checklist and Cutover Plan". However, I should also check private channels. That's because there's a possibility the user is a member. The request is about the "active launch channel". Let me try checking the private channels too.
Command: curl -sS -X POST https://slack.com/api/conversations.list -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' --data 'types=public_channel,private_channel&exclude_archived=true&limit=1000' | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
if not d.get('ok'):
    print('ERROR:', d); sys.exit(0)
print('public:', len(d.get('channels',[])), 'private:', len(d.get('private_channels',[])))
for c in d.get('private_channels',[]):
    t=c.get('topic',{}).get('value','') or ''
    if t:
        print(c['id'], '|', c['name'], '|', t)
"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "public: 1 private: 0"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: The user is asking me to invite Omar Haddad to a Slack channel whose topic is "Go-live checklist and cutover plan." However, the channel list only shows "watercooler," and the topic is "Weekend plans and pet photos." No launch channel exists with that topic.

Just to be safe, let me check for archived channels too.
Command: curl -sS -X POST https://slack.com/api/conversations.list -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' --data 'types=public_channel,private_channel&exclude_archived=false&limit=1000' | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
if not d.get('ok'):
    print('ERROR:', d); sys.exit(0)
for group in ('channels','private_channels'):
    for c in d.get(group,[]):
        t=c.get('topic',{}).get('value','') or ''
        print(c['id'], '|', c['name'], '| archived:', c.get('is_archived'), '| topic:', t)
"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "CD7JL26BET6 | launch-retro | archived: True | topic: Go-live checklist and cutover plan\nC4KU58WMRKJ | old-launch-notes | archived: True | topic: Retro notes from last quarter\nCJ5RS1XHYIB | watercooler | archived: False | topic: Weekend plans and pet photos"}

#### Step 6
Reasoning: Only one channel has that topic, `launch-retro` (CD7JL26BET6), but it's archived. The user was asking for the "active" launch channel with that topic. Since the only channel with that topic is archived, there's no active launch channel with that topic. Per the instructions, I should just tell them so.

There isn't one. The only channel with the topic "Go-live checklist and cutover plan" is `#launch-retro`, but it's archived — so there's no active launch channel to invite Omar Haddad to. (For reference, I found Omar Haddad in the workspace: `omar.haddad@northwind.example`.)

Want me to unarchive `#launch-retro` and invite him there, or invite him to a different channel?
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
There isn't one. The only channel with the topic "Go-live checklist and cutover plan" is `#launch-retro`, but it's archived — so there's no active launch channel to invite Omar Haddad to. (For reference, I found Omar Haddad in the workspace: `omar.haddad@northwind.example`.)

Want me to unarchive `#launch-retro` and invite him there, or invite him to a different channel?
