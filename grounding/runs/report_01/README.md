# report_01: evaluation and results, a paper stub

[report.md](report.md) is the stub for a paper's evaluation and results sections, written 2026-09-29 over the
studies before it: [fact_coverage_01](../fact_coverage_01/README.md) (the catalog and the credit rule),
[autogen_01](../autogen_01/README.md) and [autogen_02](../autogen_02/overview.md) (the generator, the judge and the
toy harness's runs), [openclaw_eval_01](../openclaw_eval_01/README.md) and [completion_01](../completion_01/README.md)
(roadmap 6a and 6b on OpenClaw), and [judge_baselines_01](../judge_baselines_01/README.md) (6c). Two sections
report studies on other branches: the generator baselines (`exp/baselines-01`) and step 5's extensions
(`exp/automation-01`).

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| [report.md](report.md) | The report |
| [report_concise.md](report_concise.md) | Shorter report: 1,006 methodology cases, final OpenClaw executions, combined writer groups, and estimated solver costs |
| [kit/](kit/) | One script per table group; each reads committed run records and writes one JSON file. No model calls, no agent runs |
| [numbers/](numbers/) | The scripts' outputs, which the report's tables cite |

Run a script from the repository root with the kit's Python (the backend's virtualenv):

```bash

python grounding/runs/fact_coverage_02/launch.py grounding.runs.report_01.kit.concise  # concise report: writes only numbers/concise.json
```

`concise.py` selects final executions, combines writers, filters the blind-label and judge-comparison samples,
and recomputes the equal-budget Muse comparison. It reads baseline summaries from `runs/baselines_01` or, if
still unmerged, `.claude/worktrees/baselines-01/grounding/runs/baselines_01`, and includes those summaries in its
output. The concise report's token estimate scales the historical average to 3,018 executions; it is not an
exact usage audit of that subset. Its price table states the rates, sources and calculation separately.

`numbers/awareness_full_03.json` and `numbers/awareness_full_04.json` come from openclaw_eval_01's
`test_awareness.py` on those runs.

`qwen_usage.py` uses only the Python standard library and reads the original proxy metadata, including cached
input and missing usage, without changing run evidence. It separates the main evaluation, RQ8's fresh baseline
and ablation runs, and stopped/smoke runs. If the baseline branch is still separate, pass
`--baselines-root .claude/worktrees/baselines-01/grounding/runs/baselines_01` from the repository root.

## Recount under the 10-minute budget (2026-09-30)

On 2026-09-29 the PI set the solver's budget to 10 minutes, OpenClaw's own turn limit, which every final run used;
the earlier reading of 8 minutes (runs between 8 and 10 minutes counted as timed out) is withdrawn.
`openclaw_eval_01/rulings.py` now counts a run as over budget only when OpenClaw's limit ended it. The scores
(`*.adjudicated.json`, `final_regular*.json`, `policy/decisions_population_*.json`) and the numbers here were rebuilt.

| Number | 8 minutes (report text) | 10 minutes (numbers/) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Regular runs over budget | 104 | 52 |
| Regular tests exposing a fact | 138 of 565 | 143 of 565; 139 of 563 after the two rulings below |
| Facts exposed, detect@3 / detect@1 | 87 / 60 | 88 / 61; 87 / 60 after the two rulings below |
| Policy decisions | 5 not policy-level, 3 undecided | the same 5 and 3, at lower failure rates |
| Box absence rate | 0.79 [0.74, 0.85] | 0.77 [0.71, 0.83] |
| Slack underspecified rate | 0.82 [0.75, 0.89] | 0.77 [0.69, 0.84] |

**The report texts (report.md, report_concise.md) still carry the 8-minute numbers**; their tables are to be
updated from `numbers/` (RQ4, RQ6, §0.4's execution categories, the limits section).

**Two of the PI's blind-review rulings applied to the rulings file (2026-09-30, 01:30):** G4-BOX-11's witness 8201
("Seaport Archive 2024" matches "the Seaport Archive folder") and G4-BOX-02's witness 8112 (a copy in a subfolder
of the named folder) are flawed, group B. Found by the sol_score session; they had never reached
`roadmap_01/known_defects.json`. Two probes leave the suite (563 tests); Box absence has 58 valid units and Box
underspecified 52; every decision stands.

**numbers/ rebuilt in full at 02:00 (2026-09-30)** after the two rulings: `kit/concise.py` now skips the policy
executions of units the rulings exclude and records the counts instead of asserting the old ones. The final manifest
is **998 cases, 2,994 executions** (regular 1,689; absence 726; underspecified 579); 18 policy executions of the 6
excluded units and 6 regular executions of the 2 excluded probes leave it. Studies that used the earlier 3,018
manifest (blind_review_01, judge_qwen_01, values_01) keep their own populations.
