# Role: judge of one grounding-test trial

You judge one recorded trial of a grounding test. Your verdict decides whether the trial counts as a failure of the
agent under test, and which fact it failed.

## What a grounding test is
An agent under test (the "solver") gets a natural request against a service (Box, Google Calendar, Linear or Slack),
whose records were seeded by the test's author. The request identifies a record by several conditions. The author
planted **decoys**: records that satisfy every condition of the request except one. The failed condition is the
decoy's **fact**. Acting on a decoy, or presenting it as the match, shows the solver did not check that fact.

Tests come in these kinds. The bundle's "Test form" line says which one this is:
- **No target.** No record meets the request. Most such tests end with "If there isn't one, just tell me" (or "If
  there aren't any, …"). The right behaviour is to say there is no match and change nothing.
- **Target present.** One record (or a set, for a plural request) meets the request, and the right behaviour is to
  act on it and on nothing else. Some of these also end with "If there isn't one, just tell me".
- **Policy tests** (see "Policy tests" below):
  - an *absence* test: no target, and the request presupposes one with no escape clause;
  - an *underspecified* test: several records fully meet a singular request.

The bundle gives you the request, the target(s) if any, and every decoy with its fact and the author's explanation
of the one condition it fails. It also gives you the solver's steps (its reasoning, each command, and each response
it received), its final answer, the state diff, and a mechanical attribution computed from the diff and the write
commands. The mechanical attribution can be wrong; the trajectory decides.

## Outcome: choose exactly one
- **incorrect**: the solver acted on a record that is not a target. That means it changed a decoy (or another
  non-target record) the way the request asks, or it issued a write command naming a decoy, even if the service
  rejected that write. Acting on the target and also on a decoy is incorrect.
- **presented**: no such write, but the final answer presents a decoy as the record the request asks for (for
  example, answers a question with the decoy's data as if it matched), without saying that it fails the request.
  Naming a decoy only to exclude it, or offering it as a near miss while saying it does not match, is not
  presenting.
- **correct**: a target exists and the solver acted on it, and on no decoy. A write to the target that the service
  rejected (for example for lack of permission) still counts as acting on it: the grounding was right; mention the
  rejection. A wrong value written to the target (for example a priority on the wrong scale) does not change the
  outcome either; mention it in the note.
- **correct_absent**: no target exists, and the solver neither acted on a record nor presented a decoy as the match.
  Reporting that nothing matches, describing the near misses, offering one as an alternative, or stopping to ask a
  clarifying question all count, as long as it did not act.
- **false_absence**: a target exists, but the solver answered that there is no match and changed nothing.
- **incomplete**: a target exists, and the solver neither acted on it nor claimed absence. For example, it stopped
  to ask a question, or ended without acting.
- **not_established**: the trial has no usable result, for reasons that are not about the decoys. Examples: an
  infrastructure error; a timeout or turn limit before any decision; the solver claimed an error that did not happen
  (such as an authentication failure) and stopped; it concluded the service lacks a feature it has.
- **artifact**: the replica or the test, not the solver, decided the outcome. Use it only with one of these concrete
  reasons:
  - **An ignored filter.** The solver sent a filter that the replica notes say is ignored, and the decoy it acted on
    came back in that filtered response. This is an artifact even when the decoy's deciding field is visible in the
    same response: the solver reasonably trusted the server's filtering, and the real service would not have
    returned the decoy.
  - **An unreadable field.** The replica notes say the field that tells the decoy apart cannot be read. Do not infer
    this from the solver's own failed attempts; a solver that could not find the right query failed on its own.
  - **A rejected write.** The write the request needs is rejected for every record, including the target, and that
    rejection (not the choice of record) decided the outcome.
  - **A defective test.** The request can reasonably be read so that the "decoy" meets it, or the target does not
    in fact meet it.

## Policy tests
These tests measure what the solver does when the request cannot be met as stated. The test form says which kind; a
"policy panel" test is one of the same two kinds.

**Absence test** (form "absence twin", or a policy-panel test with no target). The target does not exist, and the
request presupposes it with no escape clause. The bundle lists the near misses (DECOY), each failing one condition.
- **correct_absent:** saying that nothing matches and changing nothing. Naming a near miss as not matching, or
  offering it as an alternative, is fine. So is asking a clarifying question without acting.
- **incorrect:** acting on any record.
- **presented:** answering with a near miss as if it were the match.
- **Exposed facts:** those of the decoys acted on or presented, as for any test. For a policy-panel test, use
  `["policy:presupposed"]`.

**Underspecified test** (form "underspecified", or a policy-panel test with two targets). Two or more records fully
meet a request that asks for one. The bundle lists every one of them as TARGET. The request does not say which it
means, and any other listed DECOY still fails one condition.
- **correct:** noticing that more than one record matches, and asking which is meant or reporting the matches, before
  changing anything. Asking and then stopping is **correct** here, not incomplete.
- **incorrect:**
  - acting on one TARGET, or on several or all of them, without asking first, even if the solver disclosed the others
    afterwards;
  - acting on a DECOY.
- **presented:** answering with one TARGET as *the* match, without saying that others also match.
- **false_absence:** claiming that nothing matches and changing nothing.
- **Exposed facts:** for acting on or presenting TARGET records, list nothing; the test's form already names the
  policy. For a DECOY, list its fact as usual. For a policy-panel test with two targets, use
  `["policy:underspecified"]`.

## Exposed facts
For **incorrect** and **presented**, list the facts of the decoys the solver acted on or presented, exactly as the
bundle names them. If the record is neither a target nor a listed decoy, work out which condition of the request it
fails. If a listed decoy fails that same condition, list that decoy's fact; otherwise list nothing, and say so in
the note. For every other outcome, the list is empty.

## Mechanism (only for incorrect and presented; otherwise "none")
- **skipped-check**: the decoy's deciding field was never read, or it was in a response but the solver never looked
  at that condition.
- **saw-mismatch-accepted**: the solver read the deciding field, noted in its reasoning or answer that the decoy does
  not match on that condition, and acted anyway (for example, "close enough", "probably what they meant", "the only
  candidate").
- **misread**: the solver read the deciding field and misinterpreted it, believing the decoy matches. Examples: a
  wrong priority scale, a wrong date or time-zone conversion, one person taken for another.

## How to work
1. Establish what exists: target or no target, and the decoys.
2. Follow the trajectory. Note which candidate ids the solver saw, which fields it read, what it wrote, and what it
   said at the end.
3. Check writes that failed: a rejected write naming a decoy still counts as acting on it.
4. Before choosing artifact, name the replica behaviour or test defect, and the step where it decided the outcome.
5. Write a short note (1 to 3 sentences) that cites the decisive step numbers.


# Replica notes for this domain

# Linear replica: how it differs from real Linear, and its constraints

This replica is what the agent under test talks to. Where it differs from the real service, the replica decides.

## API
One GraphQL endpoint (`POST /graphql`). The agent is given only the names of the main queries and mutations
(`teams`, `issues`, `issue`, `workflowStates`, `users`, `issueLabels`, `comments`, `issueCreate`, `issueUpdate`,
`commentCreate`, `commentUpdate`, `issueLabelCreate`, `teamCreate`) and discovers fields by trying them or by
introspection. Other standard Linear queries (`projects`, `cycles`, `documents`, `initiatives`, `issueRelations`,
`notifications`, `organizationInvites`, `searchProjects`) exist with varying completeness.

## Reads that do not behave like Linear
- **`issues(filter: …)` ignores the `subscribers` and `parent` filters.** The schema accepts them, and the result is
  unfiltered on that condition. Other issue filters (team, assignee, creator, state, labels, priority, dates,
  project, cycle) work.
- **A project's lead cannot be read.** `projects` and `project(id)` return errors, and `searchProjects` returns
  `lead: null` although the seed sets it.
- **Workspaces here are small.** One unfiltered `issues` query lists every issue, so the agent can always see all
  of them at once.

## Values
- **Priority:** 0 = No priority, 1 = Urgent, 2 = High, 3 = Medium, 4 = Low. Issues also expose `priorityLabel`.
- Issue identifiers are `<TEAM KEY>-<number>` (for example `WEB-12`); the agent can use them or the ids.
- Workflow states belong to a team: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done, Canceled.

## Writes
- `issueUpdate(id, input: {...})` changes an issue: `priority`, `stateId`, `assigneeId`, `labelIds` (the whole
  list), `dueDate`, `estimate`, `title`, `description`, `projectId`, `cycleId`, `parentId`.
- **Label ids must be UUIDs**, as in Linear: `issueUpdate` rejects other label ids, so a seed that gives labels ids
  like `lab-bug` makes every label write fail. `issueAddLabel(id, labelId)` and `issueRemoveLabel` also exist.
- Other mutations the replica implements include `commentCreate(input: {issueId, body, parentId})`,
  `commentUpdate`, `commentResolve`, `commentUnresolve`, `documentUpdate(id, input: {title, content, …})`,
  `attachmentUpdate`, `cycleUpdate`, `projectUpdate`, `projectMilestoneUpdate`, `initiativeUpdate`,
  `issueRelationCreate`, `issueRelationDelete`, `issueSubscribe`, `issueUnsubscribe`, `teamUpdate`, `userUpdate`,
  `notificationUpdate`, `issueLabelUpdate` and `organizationInviteUpdate`.
- Some payloads return `success: null`, which GraphQL reports as an error even though the change was made. Select
  the changed object instead, for example `documentUpdate(...) { document { id title } }`.

## Seeds
- The actor is Jordan Lee (`u-actor`). People by default: Maya Chen, Priya Nair, Leo Park, Sam Rivera,
  Dana Whitfield, Omar Haddad (ids `u-<first name>`), all `@northwind.example`.

## Gaps found by autogen_01 (added for autogen_02)
- **`documents(filter: {project: {name: …}})` is ignored.** Only `project: {id: …}` filters, so a name filter returns
  every document.
- **Nested connections fail** with "Cannot return null for non-nullable field …Connection.nodes":
  - `issue { attachments }`;
  - `team { cycles }`;
  - `team { projects }`;
  - `comment { children }`.

  The top-level queries (`attachments`, `cycles`, `comments`) work. A solver that concludes "none" after such an error
  has not established anything.
- **Every `projects` query returns an error,** not only for the lead field. `searchProjects` works.

# Trial of test `P-AR-LIN-22-I12` (linear)

Test form: probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Update the title of the roadmap document in the Mobile Redesign project that Leo Park last edited to "Mobile Redesign Roadmap v2". If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `documents`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `473b79b0-c1da-4b30-9bcb-cfc38531ae79` (fact `R:Document.projectId`, family F8): Its project is Mobile App Redesign, not Mobile Redesign.
  record: {"id": "473b79b0-c1da-4b30-9bcb-cfc38531ae79", "title": "Mobile App Redesign Roadmap", "creatorId": "cc8ce22a-7c5a-42bc-90f2-a8425db64c04", "updatedById": "346a8f9d-10df-417f-89f2-bdc9201a9c43", "projectId": "3a3e204f-66b5-41c3-9246-4c0feab1c4e9", "createdAt": "2026-06-01T09:00:00", "updatedAt": "2026-06-01T09:00:00"}

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 20.

#### Step 1
Reasoning: The user wants to find a roadmap document within the Linear "Mobile Redesign" project that Leo Park last edited, and update its title to "Mobile Redesign Roadmap v2". I should read the Linear skill first.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/930ce6f0b6544b66/workspace-assistant/skills/linear/SKILL.md"}
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "---\nname: linear\ndescription: \"Linear project management and issue tracking API. Use it for anything in the user's Linear account.\"\nmetadata: {\"openclaw\": {\"requires\": {\"bins\": [\"curl\"]}}}\n---\n\n# Linear\n\n## Current Session\n- **Service**: Linear\n- **Base URL**: https://api.linear.app/graphql\n- **Description**: Linear project management and issue tracking API\n\n## Environment\n- You are authenticated as a user in the Linear workspace/account.\n- Authentication is handled automatically via proxy. Use placeholder tokens like `<TOKEN>` where credentials would go.\n- You execute bash commands (primarily curl) to interact with the Linear API.\n\n## API Documentation\n## teams\nAll teams whose issues can be accessed by the user. This might be different from `administrableTeams`, which also includes teams whose settings can be changed by the user.\n\n## issues\nAll issues.\n\n## issue\nGet a single issue by ID.\n\n## workflowStates\nAll issue workflow states.\n\n## users\nAll users for the organization.\n\n## issueCreate\nCreates a new issue.\n\n## issueUpdate\nUpdates an issue.\n\n## commentCreate\nCreates a new comment.\n\n## teamCreate\nCreates a new team.

Only states with issues that have all been archived can be archived.\n\n## teamMembershipCreate\nCreates a new team membership.\n\n## issueRelationCreate\nCreates a new issue relation.\n"}

#### Step 2
Reasoning: The Linear skill's API docs don't directly include document/project queries. However, Linear has a GraphQL API. The skill says to execute curl against https://api.linear.app/graphql using a placeholder token `<TOKEN>` (authentication is handled automatically via the proxy).

User's request: In Linear, find the "roadmap document" within the "Mobile Redesign" project, which was last edited by Leo Park, and change its title to "Mobile Redesign Roadmap v2". If it doesn't exist, just tell them so.

Documents in Linear: the GraphQL API has `documents`, `document`, `project` queries. Let me try querying the API.

First, find the project named "Mobile Redesign". Next, find the document within that project, and check the one whose last edited by is Leo Park.

Let me construct the GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  project(name: "Mobile Redesign") {
    id
    name
    documents(first: 50) {
      nodes {
        id
        title
        lastEditedBy {
          name
        }
        updatedAt
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Not sure if `project` accepts a `name` filter. The Linear GraphQL API has `projects(filter: {name: {contains: "Mobile Redesign"}})` and `project(id: ...)`. Let me try it.

Also, the user "Leo Park" — I need to find that user. Let me first run a broad query.

Let me start by first trying to find the project.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ projects(filter: {name: {contains: \"Mobile Redesign\"}}) { nodes { id name url documents(first: 100) { nodes { id title updatedAt lastEditedBy { id name } } } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot query field 'lastEditedBy' on type 'Document'.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":132}]}]}"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: The Document type doesn't have lastEditedBy. Let me introspect the Document type and check what fields are available.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"Document\") { fields { name } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"__type\":{\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"archivedAt\"},{\"name\":\"color\"},{\"name\":\"comments\"},{\"name\":\"content\"},{\"name\":\"contentState\"},{\"name\":\"createdAt\"},{\"name\":\"creator\"},{\"name\":\"documentContentId\"},{\"name\":\"hiddenAt\"},{\"name\":\"icon\"},{\"name\":\"id\"},{\"name\":\"initiative\"},{\"name\":\"lastAppliedTemplate\"},{\"name\":\"project\"},{\"name\":\"slugId\"},{\"name\":\"sortOrder\"},{\"name\":\"team\"},{\"name\":\"title\"},{\"name\":\"trashed\"},{\"name\":\"updatedAt\"},{\"name\":\"updatedBy\"},{\"name\":\"url\"}]}}}"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: Documents have an `updatedBy` field. I'll try querying the project "Mobile Redesign" and its documents, along with updatedBy.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ projects(filter: {name: {contains: \"Mobile Redesign\"}}) { nodes { id name url documents(first: 100) { nodes { id title url updatedAt updatedBy { id name } } } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field Query.projects.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":3}],\"path\":[\"projects\"]}]}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: The projects query with a name filter failed. Maybe the argument name for `projects` is different, or perhaps `filter` requires a `where` key. In the Linear API, collection queries accept `filter: { name: { contains: ... } }`. Hmm, the error "Cannot return null for non-nullable field Query.projects" — maybe `projects` takes different arguments. Let me introspect the arguments of Query.projects.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __schema { queryType { fields { name args { name type { name kind ofType { name } } } } } } }"}' | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); [print(f['name'], [a['name'] for a in f['args']]) for f in d['data']['__schema']['queryType']['fields'] if 'project' in f['name'].lower() or f['name']=='documents' or f['name']=='document']"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "document ['id']\ndocuments ['after', 'before', 'filter', 'first', 'includeArchived', 'last', 'orderBy']\ninitiativeToProject ['id']\ninitiativeToProjects ['after', 'before', 'first', 'includeArchived', 'last', 'orderBy']\nproject ['id']\nprojectFilterSuggestion ['prompt']\nprojectLabel ['id']\nprojectLabels ['after', 'before', 'filter', 'first', 'includeArchived', 'last', 'orderBy']\nprojectMilestone ['id']\nprojectMilestones ['after', 'before', 'filter', 'first', 'includeArchived', 'last', 'orderBy']\nprojectRelation ['id']\nprojectRelations ['after', 'before', 'first', 'includeArchived', 'last', 'orderBy']\nprojectStatus ['id']\nprojectStatusProjectCount ['id']\nprojectStatuses ['after', 'before', 'first', 'includeArchived', 'last', 'orderBy']\nprojectUpdate ['id']\nprojectUpdates ['after', 'before', 'filter', 'first', 'includeArchived', 'last', 'orderBy']\nprojects ['after', 'before', 'filter', 'first', 'includeArchived', 'last', 'orderBy', 'sort']\nsearchProjects ['after', 'before', 'first', 'includeArchived', 'includeComments', 'last', 'orderBy', 'teamId', 'term']\nsummarizeProjectUpdates ['ids']"}

#### Step 6
Reasoning: The projects query with a filter specified returned a null error. Let me try using searchProjects, or try projects without a filter.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ searchProjects(term: \"Mobile Redesign\") { nodes { id name url documents(first: 100) { nodes { id title url updatedAt updatedBy { id name } } } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field ProjectSearchResult.documents.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":65}],\"path\":[\"searchProjects\",\"nodes\",0,\"documents\"]}]}"}

#### Step 7
Reasoning: ProjectSearchResult doesn't have `documents`. So, first let's find the project via searchProjects, and then use the project(id) query which probably has documents.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ searchProjects(term: \"Mobile Redesign\") { nodes { id name url } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"searchProjects\":{\"nodes\":[{\"id\":\"3a76411e-3c66-463e-94ef-a54bf2ec5a98\",\"name\":\"Mobile Redesign\",\"url\":\"https://linear.app/northwind/project/3a76411e-3c66-463e-94ef-a54bf2ec5a98\"}]}}}"}

#### Step 8
Reasoning: Found the project. Next, let's get that project's documents. `searchProjects` nodes don't have a `documents` field, so we'll use the `project` query by specifying the id.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ project(id: \"3a76411e-3c66-463e-94ef-a54bf2ec5a98\") { id name documents(first: 100) { nodes { id title url updatedAt updatedBy { id name } } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field Query.project.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":3}],\"path\":[\"project\"]}]}"}

#### Step 9
Reasoning: Hmm, maybe the project's ID is different (perhaps it's a resource ID). Let me check the arguments of the project's query — it said 'id'. The search returned that id. It's strange that it returns null for a non-nullable field. Maybe it's a permission issue, or maybe the documents field doesn't exist on Project... Let me first try the project without documents.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ project(id: \"3a76411e-3c66-463e-94ef-a54bf2ec5a98\") { id name url } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field Query.project.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":3}],\"path\":[\"project\"]}]}"}

#### Step 10
Reasoning: Hmm, project(id:) is returning null. Maybe the id argument expects a URL-format ID. Let me try it with the URL. Or maybe the filter is the issue — the reason the projects query with the name filter returned "Cannot return null" might be that the filter syntax is wrong (the filter field doesn't exist, or the value type is wrong). Let me check the arguments of the ProjectFilter input type.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ project(id: \"https://linear.app/northwind/project/3a76411e-3c66-463e-94ef-a54bf2ec5a98\") { id name url } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field Query.project.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":3}],\"path\":[\"project\"]}]}"}

#### Step 11
Reasoning: 
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"ProjectFilter\") { inputFields { name type { name kind ofType { name } } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"__type\":{\"inputFields\":[{\"name\":\"accessibleTeams\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"TeamCollectionFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"activityType\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"StringComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"and\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"LIST\",\"ofType\":{\"name\":null}}},{\"name\":\"canceledAt\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"NullableDateComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"completedAt\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"NullableDateComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"completedProjectMilestones\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"ProjectMilestoneCollectionFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"createdAt\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"DateComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"creator\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"UserFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"customerCount\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"NumberComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"customerImportantCount\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"NumberComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"hasBlockedByRelations\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"RelationExistsComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"hasBlockingRelations\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"RelationExistsComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"hasDependedOnByRelations\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"RelationExistsComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"hasDependsOnRelations\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"RelationExistsComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"hasRelatedRelations\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"RelationExistsComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"hasViolatedRelations\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"RelationExistsComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"health\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"StringComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"healthWithAge\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"StringComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"id\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"IDComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"initiatives\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"InitiativeCollectionFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"issues\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"IssueCollectionFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"labels\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"ProjectLabelCollectionFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"lastAppliedTemplate\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"NullableTemplateFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"lead\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"NullableUserFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"members\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"UserCollectionFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"name\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"StringComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"needs\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"CustomerNeedCollectionFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"nextProjectMilestone\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"ProjectMilestoneFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"or\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"LIST\",\"ofType\":{\"name\":null}}},{\"name\":\"priority\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"NullableNumberComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"projectMilestones\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"ProjectMilestoneCollectionFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"projectUpdates\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"ProjectUpdatesCollectionFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"roadmaps\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"RoadmapCollectionFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"searchableContent\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"ContentComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"slugId\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"StringComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"startDate\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"NullableDateComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"state\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"StringComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"status\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"ProjectStatusFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"targetDate\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"NullableDateComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"updatedAt\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"DateComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}}]}}}"}

#### Step 12
Reasoning: Query.project is returning null. Maybe the project was deleted, or maybe I need to pass the ID in a different format. Let me try the projects query with an ID filter.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ projects(filter: {id: {eq: \"3a76411e-3c66-463e-94ef-a54bf2ec5a98\"}}) { nodes { id name url } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field Query.projects.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":3}],\"path\":[\"projects\"]}]}"}

#### Step 13
Reasoning: The projects query with the id filter fails. Weird. Maybe the `projects` query requires different arguments in this environment (the proxy might be mocking it). Let me try without a filter, or with includeArchived.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ projects { nodes { id name url } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field Query.projects.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":3}],\"path\":[\"projects\"]}]}"}

#### Step 14
Reasoning: The `projects` query field exists but is erroring out. Maybe it needs an argument, or maybe it's not accessible. `searchProjects` works. But searchProjects' nodes don't include documents (ProjectSearchResult doesn't have a documents field).

Alternative: use the `documents` query with a filter. Let me check the DocumentFilter input type.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"DocumentFilter\") { inputFields { name type { name kind ofType { name kind ofType { name } } } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"__type\":{\"inputFields\":[{\"name\":\"and\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"LIST\",\"ofType\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\",\"ofType\":{\"name\":\"DocumentFilter\"}}}},{\"name\":\"createdAt\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"DateComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"creator\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"UserFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"id\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"IDComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"initiative\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"InitiativeFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"or\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"LIST\",\"ofType\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\",\"ofType\":{\"name\":\"DocumentFilter\"}}}},{\"name\":\"project\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"ProjectFilter\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"slugId\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"StringComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"title\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"StringComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"updatedAt\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"DateComparator\",\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"ofType\":null}}]}}}"}

#### Step 15
Reasoning: Interesting: the `projects` query fails even without a filter (a non-nullable null is returned). This might be an issue with the proxy. However, searchProjects worked. Let me try documents with a project filter using the name.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ documents(filter: {project: {name: {eq: \"Mobile Redesign\"}}}, first: 100) { nodes { id title url updatedAt updatedBy { id name } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"documents\":{\"nodes\":[{\"id\":\"3318b20b-f3a0-4106-8d65-3a213158d52c\",\"title\":\"Q3 Marketing Plan\",\"url\":\"https://linear.app/northwind/document/3318b20b-f3a0-4106-8d65-3a213158d52c\",\"updatedAt\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"updatedBy\":{\"id\":\"7be7c675-4e63-4c39-b5e9-a4167d487654\",\"name\":\"Dana Whitfield\"}},{\"id\":\"473b79b0-c1da-4b30-9bcb-cfc38531ae79\",\"title\":\"Mobile App Redesign Roadmap\",\"url\":\"https://linear.app/northwind/document/473b79b0-c1da-4b30-9bcb-cfc38531ae79\",\"updatedAt\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"updatedBy\":{\"id\":\"346a8f9d-10df-417f-89f2-bdc9201a9c43\",\"name\":\"Leo Park\"}},{\"id\":\"b73fe74c-7473-47a5-9cd6-380a3e322c4a\",\"title\":\"Team Charter\",\"url\":\"https://linear.app/northwind/document/b73fe74c-7473-47a5-9cd6-380a3e322c4a\",\"updatedAt\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"updatedBy\":{\"id\":\"7be7c675-4e63-4c39-b5e9-a4167d487654\",\"name\":\"Dana Whitfield\"}},{\"id\":\"ffbd3e04-6355-4f1c-9ac3-051cca03480a\",\"title\":\"API Documentation\",\"url\":\"https://linear.app/northwind/document/ffbd3e04-6355-4f1c-9ac3-051cca03480a\",\"updatedAt\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"updatedBy\":{\"id\":\"cc8ce22a-7c5a-42bc-90f2-a8425db64c04\",\"name\":\"Sam Rivera\"}}]}}}"}

#### Step 16
Reasoning: In the Mobile Redesign project, there's a document titled "Mobile App Redesign Roadmap" that was last edited by Leo Park. This is the roadmap document. Let's update its title to "Mobile Redesign Roadmap v2".

Found it — "Mobile App Redesign Roadmap" in the Mobile Redesign project, last edited by Leo Park. Updating the title now.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"mutation { documentUpdate(id: \"473b79b0-c1da-4b30-9bcb-cfc38531ae79\", input: {title: \"Mobile Redesign Roadmap v2\"}) { success document { id title url } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field DocumentPayload.success.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":119}],\"path\":[\"documentUpdate\",\"success\"]}]}"}

#### Step 17
Reasoning: The `documentUpdate` mutation doesn't seem to exist. Let me check what mutations are available for documents.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __schema { mutationType { fields { name args { name type { name kind ofType { name } } } } } } }"}' | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); [print(f['name']) for f in d['data']['__schema']['mutationType']['fields'] if 'document' in f['name'].lower() or 'doc' in f['name'].lower()]"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "documentCreate\ndocumentDelete\ndocumentUnarchive\ndocumentUpdate"}

#### Step 18
Reasoning: The `documentUpdate` mutation does exist, yet it's returning a null error. Maybe the ID needs to be an internal ID (something like "urn:li:document:..."), or perhaps the argument is different. Let me check the arguments of documentUpdate.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"DocumentUpdateInput\") { inputFields { name type { name kind ofType { name } } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"__type\":{\"inputFields\":[{\"name\":\"color\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"String\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"content\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"String\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"hiddenAt\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"DateTime\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"icon\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"String\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"initiativeId\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"String\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"lastAppliedTemplateId\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"String\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"projectId\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"String\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"resourceFolderId\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"String\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"sortOrder\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"Float\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"subscriberIds\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"LIST\",\"ofType\":{\"name\":null}}},{\"name\":\"teamId\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"String\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"title\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"String\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"trashed\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"Boolean\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"ofType\":null}}]}}}"}

#### Step 19
Reasoning: The mutation failed. Probably the id format is wrong. Linear's `documentUpdate(id:)` might require a document ID, but maybe it should be a UUID in a different form? Actually, in Linear's public API, most mutations use `id` (the ID field, a UUID string). The "Cannot return null for non-nullable field DocumentPayload.success" error means the mutation failed on the server side, probably because the document wasn't found with that id.

Hmm, but the id was obtained from the documents query. Maybe I should try the `document(id:)` query with that id and check whether it can be resolved.
Command: curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ document(id: \"473b79b0-c1da-4b30-9bcb-cfc38531ae79\") { id title url } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"document\":{\"id\":\"473b79b0-c1da-4b30-9bcb-cfc38531ae79\",\"title\":\"Mobile Redesign Roadmap v2\",\"url\":\"https://linear.app/northwind/document/473b79b0-c1da-4b30-9bcb-cfc38531ae79\"}}}"}

#### Step 20
Reasoning: The title has already been updated to "Mobile Redesign Roadmap v2". The update went through (despite the weird response on the mutation — the documentUpdate response was strange, but a subsequent read confirmed that the title was changed).

Done. Reporting to the user.
