# Role: judge of one grounding-test trial

You judge one recorded trial of a grounding test. Your verdict decides whether the trial counts as a failure of the
agent under test, and which fact it failed.

## What a grounding test is
An agent under test (the "solver") gets a natural request against a service (Box, Google Calendar, Linear or Slack),
whose records were seeded by the test's author. The request identifies a record by several conditions. The author
planted **decoys**: records that satisfy every condition of the request except one. The failed condition is the
decoy's **fact**. Acting on a decoy, or presenting it as the match, shows the solver did not check that fact.

Tests come in these kinds. The bundle's "Test form" line says which one this is:
- **No target.** No record meets the request. Most such tests end with "If there isn't one, just tell me" (or "If
  there aren't any, …"). The right behaviour is to say there is no match and change nothing.
- **Target present.** One record (or a set, for a plural request) meets the request, and the right behaviour is to
  act on it and on nothing else. Some of these also end with "If there isn't one, just tell me".
- **Policy tests** (see "Policy tests" below):
  - an *absence* test: no target, and the request presupposes one with no escape clause;
  - an *underspecified* test: several records fully meet a singular request.

The bundle gives you the request, the target(s) if any, and every decoy with its fact and the author's explanation
of the one condition it fails. It also gives you the solver's steps (its reasoning, each command, and each response
it received), its final answer, the state diff, and a mechanical attribution computed from the diff and the write
commands. The mechanical attribution can be wrong; the trajectory decides.

## Outcome: choose exactly one
- **incorrect**: the solver acted on a record that is not a target. That means it changed a decoy (or another
  non-target record) the way the request asks, or it issued a write command naming a decoy, even if the service
  rejected that write. Acting on the target and also on a decoy is incorrect.
- **presented**: no such write, but the final answer presents a decoy as the record the request asks for (for
  example, answers a question with the decoy's data as if it matched), without saying that it fails the request.
  Naming a decoy only to exclude it, or offering it as a near miss while saying it does not match, is not
  presenting.
- **correct**: a target exists and the solver acted on it, and on no decoy. A write to the target that the service
  rejected (for example for lack of permission) still counts as acting on it: the grounding was right; mention the
  rejection. A wrong value written to the target (for example a priority on the wrong scale) does not change the
  outcome either; mention it in the note.
- **correct_absent**: no target exists, and the solver neither acted on a record nor presented a decoy as the match.
  Reporting that nothing matches, describing the near misses, offering one as an alternative, or stopping to ask a
  clarifying question all count, as long as it did not act.
- **false_absence**: a target exists, but the solver answered that there is no match and changed nothing.
- **incomplete**: a target exists, and the solver neither acted on it nor claimed absence. For example, it stopped
  to ask a question, or ended without acting.
- **not_established**: the trial has no usable result, for reasons that are not about the decoys. Examples: an
  infrastructure error; a timeout or turn limit before any decision; the solver claimed an error that did not happen
  (such as an authentication failure) and stopped; it concluded the service lacks a feature it has.
- **artifact**: the replica or the test, not the solver, decided the outcome. Use it only with one of these concrete
  reasons:
  - **An ignored filter.** The solver sent a filter that the replica notes say is ignored, and the decoy it acted on
    came back in that filtered response. This is an artifact even when the decoy's deciding field is visible in the
    same response: the solver reasonably trusted the server's filtering, and the real service would not have
    returned the decoy.
  - **An unreadable field.** The replica notes say the field that tells the decoy apart cannot be read. Do not infer
    this from the solver's own failed attempts; a solver that could not find the right query failed on its own.
  - **A rejected write.** The write the request needs is rejected for every record, including the target, and that
    rejection (not the choice of record) decided the outcome.
  - **A defective test.** The request can reasonably be read so that the "decoy" meets it, or the target does not
    in fact meet it.

## Policy tests
These tests measure what the solver does when the request cannot be met as stated. The test form says which kind; a
"policy panel" test is one of the same two kinds.

**Absence test** (form "absence twin", or a policy-panel test with no target). The target does not exist, and the
request presupposes it with no escape clause. The bundle lists the near misses (DECOY), each failing one condition.
- **correct_absent:** saying that nothing matches and changing nothing. Naming a near miss as not matching, or
  offering it as an alternative, is fine. So is asking a clarifying question without acting.
- **incorrect:** acting on any record.
- **presented:** answering with a near miss as if it were the match.
- **Exposed facts:** those of the decoys acted on or presented, as for any test. For a policy-panel test, use
  `["policy:presupposed"]`.

**Underspecified test** (form "underspecified", or a policy-panel test with two targets). Two or more records fully
meet a request that asks for one. The bundle lists every one of them as TARGET. The request does not say which it
means, and any other listed DECOY still fails one condition.
- **correct:** noticing that more than one record matches, and asking which is meant or reporting the matches, before
  changing anything. Asking and then stopping is **correct** here, not incomplete.
- **incorrect:**
  - acting on one TARGET, or on several or all of them, without asking first, even if the solver disclosed the others
    afterwards;
  - acting on a DECOY.
- **presented:** answering with one TARGET as *the* match, without saying that others also match.
- **false_absence:** claiming that nothing matches and changing nothing.
- **Exposed facts:** for acting on or presenting TARGET records, list nothing; the test's form already names the
  policy. For a DECOY, list its fact as usual. For a policy-panel test with two targets, use
  `["policy:underspecified"]`.

## Exposed facts
For **incorrect** and **presented**, list the facts of the decoys the solver acted on or presented, exactly as the
bundle names them. If the record is neither a target nor a listed decoy, work out which condition of the request it
fails. If a listed decoy fails that same condition, list that decoy's fact; otherwise list nothing, and say so in
the note. For every other outcome, the list is empty.

## Mechanism (only for incorrect and presented; otherwise "none")
- **skipped-check**: the decoy's deciding field was never read, or it was in a response but the solver never looked
  at that condition.
- **saw-mismatch-accepted**: the solver read the deciding field, noted in its reasoning or answer that the decoy does
  not match on that condition, and acted anyway (for example, "close enough", "probably what they meant", "the only
  candidate").
- **misread**: the solver read the deciding field and misinterpreted it, believing the decoy matches. Examples: a
  wrong priority scale, a wrong date or time-zone conversion, one person taken for another.

## How to work
1. Establish what exists: target or no target, and the decoys.
2. Follow the trajectory. Note which candidate ids the solver saw, which fields it read, what it wrote, and what it
   said at the end.
3. Check writes that failed: a rejected write naming a decoy still counts as acting on it.
4. Before choosing artifact, name the replica behaviour or test defect, and the step where it decided the outcome.
5. Write a short note (1 to 3 sentences) that cites the decisive step numbers.


# Replica notes for this domain

# Linear replica: how it differs from real Linear, and its constraints

This replica is what the agent under test talks to. Where it differs from the real service, the replica decides.

## API
One GraphQL endpoint (`POST /graphql`). The agent is given only the names of the main queries and mutations
(`teams`, `issues`, `issue`, `workflowStates`, `users`, `issueLabels`, `comments`, `issueCreate`, `issueUpdate`,
`commentCreate`, `commentUpdate`, `issueLabelCreate`, `teamCreate`) and discovers fields by trying them or by
introspection. Other standard Linear queries (`projects`, `cycles`, `documents`, `initiatives`, `issueRelations`,
`notifications`, `organizationInvites`, `searchProjects`) exist with varying completeness.

## Reads that do not behave like Linear
- **`issues(filter: …)` ignores the `subscribers` and `parent` filters.** The schema accepts them, and the result is
  unfiltered on that condition. Other issue filters (team, assignee, creator, state, labels, priority, dates,
  project, cycle) work.
- **A project's lead cannot be read.** `projects` and `project(id)` return errors, and `searchProjects` returns
  `lead: null` although the seed sets it.
- **Workspaces here are small.** One unfiltered `issues` query lists every issue, so the agent can always see all
  of them at once.

## Values
- **Priority:** 0 = No priority, 1 = Urgent, 2 = High, 3 = Medium, 4 = Low. Issues also expose `priorityLabel`.
- Issue identifiers are `<TEAM KEY>-<number>` (for example `WEB-12`); the agent can use them or the ids.
- Workflow states belong to a team: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done, Canceled.

## Writes
- `issueUpdate(id, input: {...})` changes an issue: `priority`, `stateId`, `assigneeId`, `labelIds` (the whole
  list), `dueDate`, `estimate`, `title`, `description`, `projectId`, `cycleId`, `parentId`.
- **Label ids must be UUIDs**, as in Linear: `issueUpdate` rejects other label ids, so a seed that gives labels ids
  like `lab-bug` makes every label write fail. `issueAddLabel(id, labelId)` and `issueRemoveLabel` also exist.
- Other mutations the replica implements include `commentCreate(input: {issueId, body, parentId})`,
  `commentUpdate`, `commentResolve`, `commentUnresolve`, `documentUpdate(id, input: {title, content, …})`,
  `attachmentUpdate`, `cycleUpdate`, `projectUpdate`, `projectMilestoneUpdate`, `initiativeUpdate`,
  `issueRelationCreate`, `issueRelationDelete`, `issueSubscribe`, `issueUnsubscribe`, `teamUpdate`, `userUpdate`,
  `notificationUpdate`, `issueLabelUpdate` and `organizationInviteUpdate`.
- Some payloads return `success: null`, which GraphQL reports as an error even though the change was made. Select
  the changed object instead, for example `documentUpdate(...) { document { id title } }`.

## Seeds
- The actor is Jordan Lee (`u-actor`). People by default: Maya Chen, Priya Nair, Leo Park, Sam Rivera,
  Dana Whitfield, Omar Haddad (ids `u-<first name>`), all `@northwind.example`.

## Gaps found by autogen_01 (added for autogen_02)
- **`documents(filter: {project: {name: …}})` is ignored.** Only `project: {id: …}` filters, so a name filter returns
  every document.
- **Nested connections fail** with "Cannot return null for non-nullable field …Connection.nodes":
  - `issue { attachments }`;
  - `team { cycles }`;
  - `team { projects }`;
  - `comment { children }`.

  The top-level queries (`attachments`, `cycles`, `comments`) work. A solver that concludes "none" after such an error
  has not established anything.
- **Every `projects` query returns an error,** not only for the lead field. `searchProjects` works.

# Trial of test `P-AP2-LIN-06-I12` (linear)

Test form: probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Rename the attachment titled "Marketing brief" on ENG-14 that links to Dropbox to "Marketing brief (archived)". If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `attachments`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `3d199713-ef20-4919-985c-4ea987c013f1` (fact `A:Attachment.title`, family F1): Titled 'Vendor contract draft'; the requested words sit in the Dropbox file name (marketing-brief-legacy.pdf), not in the title, but it is on ENG-14.
  record: {"id": "3d199713-ef20-4919-985c-4ea987c013f1", "issueId": "9338fb8d-b06a-4883-b86f-2514ee8fee45", "title": "Vendor contract draft", "source": {"type": "api"}, "sourceType": "api", "creatorId": "8657b78b-d211-437f-add7-838830bb0461", "groupBySource": true, "createdAt": "2026-06-01T09:00:00", "updatedAt": "2026-06-01T09:00:00"}

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 20.

#### Step 1
Reasoning: The user wants to rename an attachment in Linear. Since this falls under the Linear skill, I should first read SKILL.md.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/9ea235f613c045c1/workspace-assistant/skills/linear/SKILL.md"}
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "---\nname: linear\ndescription: \"Linear project management and issue tracking API. Use it for anything in the user's Linear account.\"\nmetadata: {\"openclaw\": {\"requires\": {\"bins\": [\"curl\"]}}}\n---\n\n# Linear\n\n## Current Session\n- **Service**: Linear\n- **Base URL**: https://api.linear.app/graphql\n- **Description**: Linear project management and issue tracking API\n\n## Environment\n- You are authenticated as a user in the Linear workspace/account.\n- Authentication is handled automatically via proxy.

Only states with issues that have all been archived can be archived.\n\n## teamMembershipCreate\nCreates a new team membership.\n\n## issueRelationCreate\nCreates a new issue relation.\n"}

#### Step 2
Reasoning: SKILL.md doesn't show any specific mutation for attachments. Let me check what the Linear API supports for attachments. The user is asking me to rename an attachment on ENG-14 titled "Marketing brief" that links to Dropbox.

The Linear GraphQL API does have attachment-related queries. Let me think about what I know about the Linear API:

- There's a query for attachments: I don't think there's a public query for listing attachments on an issue. Actually, the Linear API does have an `attachments` query that returns attachments by UUID or by issue... Let me check the Linear API docs.

Actually, the Linear API (api.linear.app/graphql) has the following:
- `attachments(filter: AttachmentFilter)` — the filter includes `uuids: [String!]`
- `attachment(uuid: String!)` — a single attachment

Regarding renaming: I think there's an `attachmentUpdate` mutation that accepts `name: String` and `uuid: String!`. Let me check the docs. I feel like the Linear API had an `attachmentUpdate` mutation, but... I'm not 100% sure. There's also an `attachmentCreate` mutation that accepts file uploads.

The SKILL.md here is truncated/abbreviated (it only lists a handful of operations, mostly issue-related). The actual Linear API has more. I can just query the schema with an introspection query to check what's available.

Also, how do I find the attachment on ENG-14 that links to Dropbox? The `issue` query might include an `attachments` field. Let me introspect the schema to find out.

Plan:
1. Introsp
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __schema { queryType { fields { name } } mutationType { fields { name } } } }"}' | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('QUERY:', [f['name'] for f in d['data']['__schema']['queryType']['fields']]); print('MUTATION:', [f['name'] for f in d['data']['__schema']['mutationType']['fields']])"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "QUERY: ['administrableTeams', 'agentActivities', 'agentActivity', 'agentSession', 'agentSessions', 'apiKeys', 'applicationInfo', 'applicationWithAuthorization', 'archivedTeams', 'attachment', 'attachmentSources', 'attachments', 'attachmentsForURL', 'auditEntries', 'auditEntryTypes', 'authenticationSessions', 'availableUsers', 'comment', 'comments', 'customView', 'customViewDetailsSuggestion', 'customViewHasSubscribers', 'customViews', 'customer', 'customerNeed', 'customerNeeds', 'customerStatus', 'customerStatuses', 'customerTier', 'customerTiers', 'customers', 'cycle', 'cycles', 'document', 'documentContentHistory', 'documents', 'emailIntakeAddress', 'emoji', 'emojis', 'entityExternalLink', 'externalUser', 'externalUsers', 'failuresForOauthWebhooks', 'favorite', 'favorites', 'fetchData', 'initiative', 'initiativeRelation', 'initiativeRelations', 'initiativeToProject', 'initiativeToProjects', 'initiativeUpdate', 'initiativeUpdates', 'initiatives', 'integration', 'integrationHasScopes', 'integrationTemplate', 'integrationTemplates', 'integrations', 'integrationsSettings', 'issue', 'issueFigmaFileKeySearch', 'issueFilterSuggestion', 'issueImportCheckCSV', 'issueImportCheckSync', 'issueImportJqlCheck', 'issueLabel', 'issueLabels', 'issuePriorityValues', 'issueRelation', 'issueRelations', 'issueSearch', 'issueTitleSuggestionFromCustomerRequest', 'issueVcsBranchSearch', 'issues', 'notification', 'notificationSubscription', 'notificationSubscriptions', 'notifications', 'notificationsUnreadCount', 'organization', 'organizationDomainClaimRequest', 'organizationExists', 'organizationInvite', 'organizationInviteDetails', 'organizationInvites', 'organizationMeta', 'project', 'projectFilterSuggestion', 'projectLabel', 'projectLabels', 'projectMilestone', 'projectMilestones', 'projectRelation', 'projectRelations', 'projectStatus', 'projectStatusProjectCount', 'projectStatuses', 'projectUpdate', 'projectUpdates', 'projects', 'pushSubscriptionTest', 'rateLimitStatus', 'searchDocuments', 'searchIssues', 'searchProjects', 'semanticSearch', 'ssoUrlFromEmail', 'summarizeProjectUpdates', 'team', 'teamMembership', 'teamMemberships', 'teams', 'template', 'templates', 'templatesForIntegration', 'timeSchedule', 'timeSchedules', 'triageResponsibilities', 'triageResponsibility', 'user', 'userSettings', 'users', 'verifyGitHubEnterpriseServerInstallation', 'viewer', 'webhook', 'webhooks', 'workflowState', 'workflowStates']\nMUTATION: ['agentActivityCreate', 'agentActivityCreatePrompt', 'agentSessionCreateOnComment', 'agentSessionCreateOnIssue', 'agentSessionUpdateExternalUrl', 'airbyteIntegrationConnect', 'apiKeyCreate', 'apiKeyDelete', 'apiKeyUpdate', 'attachmentCreate', 'attachmentDelete', 'attachmentLinkDiscord', 'attachmentLinkFront', 'attachmentLinkGitHubIssue', 'attachmentLinkGitHubPR', 'attachmentLinkGitLabMR', 'attachmentLinkIntercom', 'attachmentLinkJiraIssue', 'attachmentLinkSalesforce', 'attachmentLinkSlack', 'attachmentLinkURL',  […6314 chars omitted…] IntegrationSlackScopes', 'userDemoteAdmin', 'userDemoteMember', 'userDiscordConnect', 'userExternalUserDisconnect', 'userFlagUpdate', 'userPromoteAdmin', 'userPromoteMember', 'userSettingsFlagsReset', 'userSettingsUpdate', 'userSuspend', 'userUnlinkFromIdentityProvider', 'userUnsuspend', 'userUpdate', 'viewPreferencesCreate', 'viewPreferencesDelete', 'viewPreferencesUpdate', 'webhookCreate', 'webhookDelete', 'webhookUpdate', 'workflowStateArchive', 'workflowStateCreate', 'workflowStateUpdate']"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: I need to find issue ENG-14 and its attachments. The issue number ENG-14 means the team key is ENG. Let me first query for the issue. I can use `issueSearch` or the `issues` query. Actually, there's an easier way: Linear supports fetching issues by identifier, but the `issue` query takes an ID (UUID). `issueSearch` might accept a filter. Let me check the issueSearch filter's args.

Actually, a common approach is: `issues(filter: { number: { eq: 14 }, team: { key: { eq: "ENG" } } })`. First let me introspect the IssueWhereArgs schema to get the correct filter format. I'll do that quickly.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ teams { nodes { key name } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"teams\":{\"nodes\":[{\"key\":\"ENG\",\"name\":\"Engineering\"},{\"key\":\"MOB\",\"name\":\"Mobile\"}]}}}"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: Now, I'll check whether issue ENG-14 exists, and check its attachments.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ issue(identifier: \"ENG-14\") { id identifier title attachments { nodes { id title url source { ... on IntegrationAttachmentSource { integrationType name } ... on URLAttachmentSource { url } } } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Unknown argument 'identifier' on field 'Query.issue'.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":9}]},{\"message\":\"Field 'source' must not have a selection since type 'JSONObject' has no subfields.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":95}]},{\"message\":\"Unknown type 'IntegrationAttachmentSource'.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":104}]},{\"message\":\"Unknown type 'URLAttachmentSource'. Did you mean 'AttachmentEdge'?\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":164}]},{\"message\":\"Field 'issue' argument 'id' of type 'String!' is required, but it was not provided.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":3}]}]}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: The `issue` query requires an ID (uuid). Let's find ENG-14 using the issues query with a filter.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ issues(filter: {identifier: {eq: \"ENG-14\"}}) { nodes { id identifier title } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Field 'identifier' is not defined by type 'IssueFilter'.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":19}]}]}"}

#### Step 6
Reasoning: IssueFilter doesn't have an identifier field. Let's use searchIssues, or try the query with the id "ENG-14" as-is — Linear's issue query accepts an id, and in some cases it might accept identifiers too? The error says "Unknown argument 'identifier'". Let's try using the identifier with `issue(id: "ENG-14")` — Linear's API often accepts identifiers for the id argument. Let's give it a shot.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ issue(id: \"ENG-14\") { id identifier title } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"issue\":{\"id\":\"9338fb8d-b06a-4883-b86f-2514ee8fee45\",\"identifier\":\"ENG-14\",\"title\":\"Homepage redesign\"}}}"}

#### Step 7
Reasoning: The issue exists. Next, I'll get the list of attached files. `source` is a JSONObject, so I just need to select it as-is. Let's get the title, url, and source of the attached files.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ issue(id: \"ENG-14\") { attachments { nodes { id title url size source } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot query field 'size' on type 'Attachment'.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":60}]}]}"}

#### Step 8
Reasoning: Interesting — so the source type is JSONObject. Let me check the fields of the Attachment type.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"Attachment\") { fields { name type { name kind } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"__type\":{\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"archivedAt\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"DateTime\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\"}},{\"name\":\"bodyData\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"String\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\"}},{\"name\":\"createdAt\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\"}},{\"name\":\"creator\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"User\",\"kind\":\"OBJECT\"}},{\"name\":\"externalUserCreator\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"ExternalUser\",\"kind\":\"OBJECT\"}},{\"name\":\"groupBySource\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\"}},{\"name\":\"id\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\"}},{\"name\":\"issue\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\"}},{\"name\":\"metadata\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\"}},{\"name\":\"originalIssue\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"Issue\",\"kind\":\"OBJECT\"}},{\"name\":\"source\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"JSONObject\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\"}},{\"name\":\"sourceType\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"String\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\"}},{\"name\":\"subtitle\",\"type\":{\"name\":\"String\",\"kind\":\"SCALAR\"}},{\"name\":\"title\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\"}},{\"name\":\"updatedAt\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\"}},{\"name\":\"url\",\"type\":{\"name\":null,\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\"}}]}}}"}

#### Step 9
Reasoning: `source` is a JSONObject scalar (probably a stringified JSON). Let me query the attachments of ENG-14.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ issue(id: \"ENG-14\") { attachments { nodes { id title url sourceType source bodyData } } } }"}' | python3 -m json.tool
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\n    \"data\": null,\n    \"errors\": [\n        {\n            \"message\": \"Cannot return null for non-nullable field AttachmentConnection.nodes.\",\n            \"locations\": [\n                {\n                    \"line\": 1,\n                    \"column\": 39\n                }\n            ],\n            \"path\": [\n                \"issue\",\n                \"attachments\",\n                \"nodes\"\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}"}

#### Step 10
Reasoning: The attachments field may require an argument. Let's check the type of the attachment field.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"Issue\") { fields { includeDeprecated: true } } }" }' 2>/dev/null | head -5; curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"Issue\") { fields { name args { name type { name kind ofType { name } } } } } }"}' | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
for f in d['data']['__type']['fields']:
    if f['name']=='attachments':
        print(json.dumps(f, indent=2))

#### Step 11
Reasoning: The attachments field exists, but nodes returned an error "Cannot return null for non-nullable field AttachmentConnection.nodes." This is probably a permission issue — maybe the current user can't see the attachments, or the connection needs `first`. Let me try with `first: 20` attached.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ issue(id: \"ENG-14\") { attachments(first: 20) { nodes { id title url sourceType source } } } }"}' | python3 -m json.tool
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\n    \"data\": null,\n    \"errors\": [\n        {\n            \"message\": \"Cannot return null for non-nullable field AttachmentConnection.nodes.\",\n            \"locations\": [\n                {\n                    \"line\": 1,\n                    \"column\": 50\n                }\n            ],\n            \"path\": [\n                \"issue\",\n                \"attachments\",\n                \"nodes\"\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}"}

#### Step 12
Reasoning: Strange error — it's a problem with the nodes in AttachmentConnection. Maybe I need `edges` instead of `nodes`? Or perhaps the issue's attachments require a different query structure. Let me check the type of AttachmentConnection.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"AttachmentConnection\") { fields { name type { name kind ofType { name kind } } } } }"}' | python3 -m json.tool
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"__type\": {\n            \"fields\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"edges\",\n                    \"type\": {\n                        \"name\": null,\n                        \"kind\": \"NON_NULL\",\n                        \"ofType\": {\n                            \"name\": null,\n                            \"kind\": \"LIST\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"nodes\",\n                    \"type\": {\n                        \"name\": null,\n                        \"kind\": \"NON_NULL\",\n                        \"ofType\": {\n                            \"name\": null,\n                            \"kind\": \"LIST\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"pageInfo\",\n                    \"type\": {\n                        \"name\": null,\n                        \"kind\": \"NON_NULL\",\n                        \"ofType\": {\n                            \"name\": \"PageInfo\",\n                            \"kind\": \"OBJECT\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}"}

#### Step 13
Reasoning: The "Cannot return null for non-nullable field AttachmentConnection.nodes" error when querying issue.attachments is weird. Maybe in this mock/proxy environment, the `attachments` field on `Issue` isn't supported, or the proxy is returning something weird. Let me try a top-level `attachments` query, or `attachment` by id. Also, I'll try the `attachmentsForURL` query.

Actually, let me test whether a simple attachments query on issue works at all:
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ issue(id: \"ENG-14\") { attachments(first: 20) { edges { node { id title } } pageInfo { hasNextPage } } } }"}' | head -c 2000
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field AttachmentConnection.edges.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":50}],\"path\":[\"issue\",\"attachments\",\"edges\"]}]}"}

#### Step 14
Reasoning: 
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ attachments(first: 50) { nodes { id title url sourceType source issue { identifier } } } }"}' | head -c 4000
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"attachments\":{\"nodes\":[{\"id\":\"3d199713-ef20-4919-985c-4ea987c013f1\",\"title\":\"Vendor contract draft\",\"url\":\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/7h8j9k1l2m/marketing-brief-legacy.pdf\",\"sourceType\":\"api\",\"source\":{\"type\":\"api\"},\"issue\":{\"identifier\":\"ENG-14\"}},{\"id\":\"eb5cde33-5c1b-41c0-b6bd-fc6c2871fc30\",\"title\":\"Design mockups\",\"url\":\"https://www.figma.com/file/abcxyz/homepage\",\"sourceType\":\"api\",\"source\":{\"type\":\"api\"},\"issue\":{\"identifier\":\"ENG-14\"}}]}}}"}

#### Step 15
Reasoning: Interesting. The `attachments` query (probably across the entire organization) is showing the following:

1. "Vendor contract draft" — links to a Dropbox URL (`https://www.dropbox.com/s/7h8j9k1l2m/marketing-brief-legacy.pdf`) on ENG-14.
2. "Design mockups" — a Figma link on ENG-14.

There's no attachment titled "Marketing brief". The one titled "Vendor contract draft" does link to Dropbox (the URL's path contains "marketing-brief-legacy.pdf", but the title isn't "Marketing brief").

Just to be safe, let me recheck with includeArchived, or a broader query (maybe there are more attachments beyond the first 50 — only 2 came back). Also, I'll check for other attachments on ENG-14 with the issue filter. Let me try a filter on the attachments query. I'll also check for archived attachments.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"AttachmentFilter\") { inputFields { name } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"__type\":{\"inputFields\":[{\"name\":\"and\"},{\"name\":\"createdAt\"},{\"name\":\"creator\"},{\"name\":\"id\"},{\"name\":\"or\"},{\"name\":\"sourceType\"},{\"name\":\"subtitle\"},{\"name\":\"title\"},{\"name\":\"updatedAt\"},{\"name\":\"url\"}]}}}"}

#### Step 16
Reasoning: 
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"Query\") { fields { name args { name type { name } } } } }" }' 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
for f in d['data']['__type']['fields']:
    if f['name'] in ('attachment','attachments','attachmentsForURL','attachmentSources'):
        print(json.dumps(f, indent=1))
"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\n \"name\": \"attachment\",\n \"args\": [\n  {\n   \"name\": \"id\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": null\n   }\n  }\n ]\n}\n{\n \"name\": \"attachmentSources\",\n \"args\": [\n  {\n   \"name\": \"teamId\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"String\"\n   }\n  }\n ]\n}\n{\n \"name\": \"attachments\",\n \"args\": [\n  {\n   \"name\": \"after\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"String\"\n   }\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"before\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"String\"\n   }\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"filter\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"AttachmentFilter\"\n   }\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"first\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"Int\"\n   }\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"includeArchived\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"Boolean\"\n   }\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"last\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"Int\"\n   }\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"orderBy\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"PaginationOrderBy\"\n   }\n  }\n ]\n}\n{\n \"name\": \"attachmentsForURL\",\n \"args\": [\n  {\n   \"name\": \"after\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"String\"\n   }\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"before\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"String\"\n   }\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"first\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"Int\"\n   }\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"includeArchived\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"Boolean\"\n   }\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"last\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"Int\"\n   }\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"orderBy\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": \"PaginationOrderBy\"\n   }\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"url\",\n   \"type\": {\n    \"name\": null\n   }\n  }\n ]\n}"}

#### Step 17
Reasoning: Let's try searching for attachments with the title "Marketing brief" and check everything (including archived ones).
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ attachments(filter: {title: {iContains: \"Marketing brief\"}}, first: 50, includeArchived: true) { nodes { id title url sourceType archivedAt issue { identifier } } } }"}' | python3 -m json.tool
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\n    \"errors\": [\n        {\n            \"message\": \"Field 'iContains' is not defined by type 'StringComparator'. Did you mean 'contains' or 'notContains'?\",\n            \"locations\": [\n                {\n                    \"line\": 1,\n                    \"column\": 32\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}"}

#### Step 18
Reasoning: (Thinking) Let me check the available comparators and query.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ attachments(filter: {title: {contains: \"Marketing brief\"}}, first: 50, includeArchived: true) { nodes { id title url sourceType archivedAt issue { identifier } } } }"}' | python3 -m json.tool
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"attachments\": {\n            \"nodes\": []\n        }\n    }\n}"}

#### Step 19
Reasoning: No attachments matching "Marketing brief" (case-insensitive contains). Let me try a broader search — maybe with the lowercase "marketing", or check all attachments within the workspace, or check the MOB team. Also, let me try searching by "marketing" in general, and try the url field containing dropbox too.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: <TOKEN>' -d '{"query":"{ attachments(first: 100, includeArchived: true) { nodes { id title url sourceType archivedAt issue { identifier } } } }"}' | python3 -m json.tool
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"attachments\": {\n            \"nodes\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"3d199713-ef20-4919-985c-4ea987c013f1\",\n                    \"title\": \"Vendor contract draft\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/7h8j9k1l2m/marketing-brief-legacy.pdf\",\n                    \"sourceType\": \"api\",\n                    \"archivedAt\": null,\n                    \"issue\": {\n                        \"identifier\": \"ENG-14\"\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"eb5cde33-5c1b-41c0-b6bd-fc6c2871fc30\",\n                    \"title\": \"Design mockups\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.figma.com/file/abcxyz/homepage\",\n                    \"sourceType\": \"api\",\n                    \"archivedAt\": null,\n                    \"issue\": {\n                        \"identifier\": \"ENG-14\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}"}

#### Step 20
Reasoning: ENG-14 has only 2 attachments:
1. "Vendor contract draft" → Dropbox URL (marketing-brief-legacy.pdf)
2. "Design mockups" → Figma

There's no attachment with the title "Marketing brief". The Dropbox attachment does exist, but its title is "Vendor contract draft". Therefore, I can't find anything that matches the specified condition. Following the user's instruction "if it's not there, just tell me," I should just let them know without renaming.

Let me double-check the title filter — it was returning an empty array even with includeArchived: true, so I was able to confirm that no attachment with the title "Marketing brief" exists.

I should report the findings and also mention the closest match.

Nope — there's no attachment titled "Marketing brief" on ENG-14. I didn't rename anything.

What's actually attached to ENG-14:
- **"Vendor contract draft"** → links to a Dropbox file (`.../marketing-brief-legacy.pdf`)
- **"Design mockups"** → links to a Figma file

I also searched all attachments in your workspace (including archived ones) for the title "Marketing brief" — nothing.

If you meant the Dropbox one, its title is "Vendor contract draft" — say the word and I'll rename that to "Marketing brief (archived)".
