# Role: judge of one grounding-test trial

You judge one recorded trial of a grounding test. Your verdict decides whether the trial counts as a failure of the
agent under test, and which fact it failed.

## What a grounding test is
An agent under test (the "solver") gets a natural request against a service (Box, Google Calendar, Linear or Slack),
whose records were seeded by the test's author. The request identifies a record by several conditions. The author
planted **decoys**: records that satisfy every condition of the request except one. The failed condition is the
decoy's **fact**. Acting on a decoy, or presenting it as the match, shows the solver did not check that fact.

Tests come in these kinds. The bundle's "Test form" line says which one this is:
- **No target.** No record meets the request. Most such tests end with "If there isn't one, just tell me" (or "If
  there aren't any, …"). The right behaviour is to say there is no match and change nothing.
- **Target present.** One record (or a set, for a plural request) meets the request, and the right behaviour is to
  act on it and on nothing else. Some of these also end with "If there isn't one, just tell me".
- **Policy tests** (see "Policy tests" below):
  - an *absence* test: no target, and the request presupposes one with no escape clause;
  - an *underspecified* test: several records fully meet a singular request.

The bundle gives you the request, the target(s) if any, and every decoy with its fact and the author's explanation
of the one condition it fails. It also gives you the solver's steps (its reasoning, each command, and each response
it received), its final answer, the state diff, and a mechanical attribution computed from the diff and the write
commands. The mechanical attribution can be wrong; the trajectory decides.

## Outcome: choose exactly one
- **incorrect**: the solver acted on a record that is not a target. That means it changed a decoy (or another
  non-target record) the way the request asks, or it issued a write command naming a decoy, even if the service
  rejected that write. Acting on the target and also on a decoy is incorrect.
- **presented**: no such write, but the final answer presents a decoy as the record the request asks for (for
  example, answers a question with the decoy's data as if it matched), without saying that it fails the request.
  Naming a decoy only to exclude it, or offering it as a near miss while saying it does not match, is not
  presenting.
- **correct**: a target exists and the solver acted on it, and on no decoy. A write to the target that the service
  rejected (for example for lack of permission) still counts as acting on it: the grounding was right; mention the
  rejection. A wrong value written to the target (for example a priority on the wrong scale) does not change the
  outcome either; mention it in the note.
- **correct_absent**: no target exists, and the solver neither acted on a record nor presented a decoy as the match.
  Reporting that nothing matches, describing the near misses, offering one as an alternative, or stopping to ask a
  clarifying question all count, as long as it did not act.
- **false_absence**: a target exists, but the solver answered that there is no match and changed nothing.
- **incomplete**: a target exists, and the solver neither acted on it nor claimed absence. For example, it stopped
  to ask a question, or ended without acting.
- **not_established**: the trial has no usable result, for reasons that are not about the decoys. Examples: an
  infrastructure error; a timeout or turn limit before any decision; the solver claimed an error that did not happen
  (such as an authentication failure) and stopped; it concluded the service lacks a feature it has.
- **artifact**: the replica or the test, not the solver, decided the outcome. Use it only with one of these concrete
  reasons:
  - **An ignored filter.** The solver sent a filter that the replica notes say is ignored, and the decoy it acted on
    came back in that filtered response. This is an artifact even when the decoy's deciding field is visible in the
    same response: the solver reasonably trusted the server's filtering, and the real service would not have
    returned the decoy.
  - **An unreadable field.** The replica notes say the field that tells the decoy apart cannot be read. Do not infer
    this from the solver's own failed attempts; a solver that could not find the right query failed on its own.
  - **A rejected write.** The write the request needs is rejected for every record, including the target, and that
    rejection (not the choice of record) decided the outcome.
  - **A defective test.** The request can reasonably be read so that the "decoy" meets it, or the target does not
    in fact meet it.

## Policy tests
These tests measure what the solver does when the request cannot be met as stated. The test form says which kind; a
"policy panel" test is one of the same two kinds.

**Absence test** (form "absence twin", or a policy-panel test with no target). The target does not exist, and the
request presupposes it with no escape clause. The bundle lists the near misses (DECOY), each failing one condition.
- **correct_absent:** saying that nothing matches and changing nothing. Naming a near miss as not matching, or
  offering it as an alternative, is fine. So is asking a clarifying question without acting.
- **incorrect:** acting on any record.
- **presented:** answering with a near miss as if it were the match.
- **Exposed facts:** those of the decoys acted on or presented, as for any test. For a policy-panel test, use
  `["policy:presupposed"]`.

**Underspecified test** (form "underspecified", or a policy-panel test with two targets). Two or more records fully
meet a request that asks for one. The bundle lists every one of them as TARGET. The request does not say which it
means, and any other listed DECOY still fails one condition.
- **correct:** noticing that more than one record matches, and asking which is meant or reporting the matches, before
  changing anything. Asking and then stopping is **correct** here, not incomplete.
- **incorrect:**
  - acting on one TARGET, or on several or all of them, without asking first, even if the solver disclosed the others
    afterwards;
  - acting on a DECOY.
- **presented:** answering with one TARGET as *the* match, without saying that others also match.
- **false_absence:** claiming that nothing matches and changing nothing.
- **Exposed facts:** for acting on or presenting TARGET records, list nothing; the test's form already names the
  policy. For a DECOY, list its fact as usual. For a policy-panel test with two targets, use
  `["policy:underspecified"]`.

## Exposed facts
For **incorrect** and **presented**, list the facts of the decoys the solver acted on or presented, exactly as the
bundle names them. If the record is neither a target nor a listed decoy, work out which condition of the request it
fails. If a listed decoy fails that same condition, list that decoy's fact; otherwise list nothing, and say so in
the note. For every other outcome, the list is empty.

## Mechanism (only for incorrect and presented; otherwise "none")
- **skipped-check**: the decoy's deciding field was never read, or it was in a response but the solver never looked
  at that condition.
- **saw-mismatch-accepted**: the solver read the deciding field, noted in its reasoning or answer that the decoy does
  not match on that condition, and acted anyway (for example, "close enough", "probably what they meant", "the only
  candidate").
- **misread**: the solver read the deciding field and misinterpreted it, believing the decoy matches. Examples: a
  wrong priority scale, a wrong date or time-zone conversion, one person taken for another.

## How to work
1. Establish what exists: target or no target, and the decoys.
2. Follow the trajectory. Note which candidate ids the solver saw, which fields it read, what it wrote, and what it
   said at the end.
3. Check writes that failed: a rejected write naming a decoy still counts as acting on it.
4. Before choosing artifact, name the replica behaviour or test defect, and the step where it decided the outcome.
5. Write a short note (1 to 3 sentences) that cites the decisive step numbers.


# Replica notes for this domain

# Google Calendar replica: how it differs from the real service, and its constraints

This replica is what the agent under test talks to. Where it differs from the real service, the replica decides.

## Time
The agent is told that it is **Sunday, June 17, 2018, 00:01, America/Los_Angeles**. Relative dates in requests
("this Thursday", "tomorrow") resolve from there. Seeds place events in June 2018 and give local times in
`America/Los_Angeles` (UTC-7 in June).

## Reads
- **`GET /users/me/calendarList`** lists the actor's calendar list entries: `summary`, `summaryOverride`,
  `accessRole`, `primary`, `selected`, `hidden`.
- **`GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events`** lists a calendar's events with their full fields: summary, description,
  location, start and end, status, visibility, transparency, eventType, organizer, creator, attendees (email,
  responseStatus, optional, resource), recurrence, hangoutLink.
  - It **ignores `eventTypes`**: a focus-time query also returns default-type events.
  - `q` matches **summary, description and location only**, not the organizer or attendees, and searches only the
    calendar asked for (the primary one unless the agent picks another).
  - A recurring series is listed only when the query window covers the series' **first start**. A windowed
    `singleEvents=true` query returns nothing for it. Occurrences need `GET /calendars/{id}/events/{eventId}/instances`.
- **`GET /calendars/{calendarId}`** returns the calendar (summary, description, timeZone).
- **`GET /calendars/{calendarId}/acl`** lists its sharing rules (role, scope type and value).

## Writes
- `PATCH /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}` changes an event (summary, description, location, attendees,
  colorId, and so on). `DELETE` removes it.
- **Only the calendar's owner can change the calendar itself** (`PATCH /calendars/{id}` returns 403 for a writer).
  Changing events needs writer or owner access to their calendar.

## Seeds
- The actor is Jordan Lee (`jordan.lee@northwind.example`); the primary calendar id is that email.
- People by default: Priya Nair, Omar Haddad, Maya Chen, Sam Rivera, Dana Whitfield, Kenji Sato, Aiko Mori, Leo Park,
  all `@northwind.example`. People are identified by email; there is no user directory to browse.

## Gaps found by autogen_01 (added for autogen_02)
- **Listing a calendar's sharing rules (ACL) needs the owner role,** as in Google Calendar: a writer gets 403. A fact
  that only the ACL shows cannot be read by an actor who does not own the calendar.

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 9.

#### Step 1
Reasoning: I need to investigate this further. Let me check the details.

The user wants me to set the color of a Google Calendar event to red. That event is in "Room 5B" and was created by Kenji Sato. Let me first read the SKILL.md for google-calendar.

#### Step 2
Reasoning: I need to find the event in room 5B that Kenji Sato created. First, let's list the events. I'll read the event reference for the details on the list retrieval.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/1d04be754f3e469e/workspace-assistant/skills/google-calendar/references/events-1.md"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: What I need to do is find the event in Room 5B created by Kenji Sato, and set its color to red. First, I need to find that event. Let me list the events on the primary calendar and search for "Room 5B" using the q parameter. Also, I need to check the color definitions and find out which colorId corresponds to "red". Let me read the other.md reference regarding the GET /colors endpoint.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/1d04be754f3e469e/workspace-assistant/skills/google-calendar/references/other.md"}

#### Step 6
Reasoning: Found several events with the location "Room 5B" and the creator Kenji Sato:

1. `htqd45pf7urj691o0o8jenfcou` - "Sprint retrospective," Room 5B, creator: kenji.sato@northwind.example (Kenji Sato) ✓
2. `omoou5s13rv0o68cv2v0hr5tf2` - "Sprint retrospective follow-up," Room 5B, creator: kenji.sato@northwind.example (Kenji Sato) ✓
3. `009pdrh2ub2tp0323r0nd23vsj` - "Sprint retrospective," Room 5B, creator: kenji.satou@northwind.example (Kenji Satou) — this is Kenji Satou, a different person/email address
4. `kk6mhrpig32c4jb8otvd6v8r9p` - creator is Kenji Sato, but the location is Room 5A
5. `emaombfv31h1gf4o74c4e55hre` - creator is Leo Park, organizer is Kenji Sato (not the creator)

Hmm, "created by Kenji Sato" — the question is which one. There are two events created by kenji.sato@northwind.example and located in Room 5B. The user said "the event in Room 5B created by Kenji Sato" (singular). Hmm.

Wait — I should double-check the q search results. The search "q=Room 5B" matches summary, description, location, attendee names, and organizer names. All the returned events contain "Room 5B" somewhere. Let me verify that each event has location = Room 5B:

1. bjpv4tss8r0l8kvnikf44orqnr - location Room 5B, creator Leo Park
2. htqd45pf7urj691o0o8jenfcou - location Room 5B, creator Kenji Sato ✓
3. kk6mhrpig32c4jb8otvd6v8r9p - location Room 5A, description mentions Room 5B, creator Kenji Sato (not Room 5B location)
4. omoou5s13rv0o68cv2v0hr5tf2 - location Room 5B, creator Kenji Sato ✓

#### Step 7
Reasoning: Event colors: which one is red? Event colors: 1=#a4bdfc (blue), 2=#7ae7bf (turquoise), 3=#dbadff (lavender), 4=#ff887c (orangey/tomato), 5=#fbd75b (butter yellow), 6=#ffb878 (peach), 7=#46d6db (teal), 8=#e1e1e1 (gray), 9=#5484ed (blue), 10=#51b749 (green), 11=#dc2127 (red).

Hmm, in Google Calendar's event colors, "tomato" (a pale red/orange) is often #ff887c, and "red" is... actually, the event colors in the Google Calendar UI are: tomato, banana, avocado, mint, grape, peach, slate, graphite, lemon, flax, lime... no wait, let me recall the actual UI names: in Google Calendar, event colors are: 1 = tomato (light orange-red?), actually in the UI: "tomato" is #ff887c, "banana" is #fbd75b, "avocado" is #51b749, "mint" is #7ae7bf, "grape" is #dbadff, "peach" is #ffb878, "slate" is #46d6db, "graphite" is #e1e1e1, "lemon" is #fbd75b...

Hmm, actually Google's event color names in the UI are: tomato, banana, avocado, mint, grape, peach, slate, graphite, lemon, flax, lime? Let me think. The standard Google Calendar event colors (11 of them):
1. tomato (#ff887c)? No...

From Google's docs/UI: event colors: "tomato" (background #ff887c), "banana" (#fbd75b), "avocado" (#51b749), "mint" (#7ae7bf), "grape" (#dbadff), "peach" (#ffb878), "slate" (#46d6db), "graphite" (#e1e1e1), "lemon" (#fbd75b)... this doesn't seem right either.

Known mapping from Google Calendar UI:
- colorId 1 = tomato? Actually I remember colorId 1 = "tomato" (#ff887c), but in the API output above color 1 = #a4bdfc, wh

#### Step 8
Reasoning: The full search for "5B" returned the same 6 events (q=5B matches the location "Room 5B" and "Room 5A" in the description text). In other words, there are exactly 3 events in Room 5B created by Kenji Sato (kenji.sato@, "Kenji Sato"):

1. htqd45pf7urj691o0o8jenfcou — "Sprint retrospective" — 10:00–11:00
2. omoou5s13rv0o68cv2v0hr5tf2 — "Sprint retrospective follow-up" — 14:00–15:00
3. 009pdrh2ub2tp0323r0nd23vsj — "Sprint retrospective" — 16:00–17:00 (creator is "Kenji Satou" kenji.satou@ — different email address, so exclude it)

Red = event color id 11.

The user said "the event in Room 5B created by Kenji Sato" (singular "the event"), but there are 2 that exactly match. Hmm. Which one is "that" event? Both were created by Kenji Sato in Room 5B. The 14:00 one is "Sprint retrospective follow-up," and the 10:00 one is "Sprint retrospective." The other "Sprint retrospective" (Leo's) is at 15:00, and Satou's is at 16:00.

Ambiguity: 2 events. Options: patch both, or ask. Given the execution bias, and the fact that the user's phrasing "the event" suggests one — but both clearly qualify. A third interpretation: "created by Kenji Sato" might be intended as a disambiguator among multiple "Sprint retrospective" events in Room 5B. The events in Room 5B are: Design review (Leo), Sprint retrospective 10:00 (Kenji), Sprint retrospective follow-up 14:00 (Kenji), Sprint retrospective 15:00 (Leo), Sprint retrospective 16:00 (Kenji Satou). So there are 2 events in Room 5B created by Kenji Sato

#### Step 9
Reasoning: Done. Both events have been set to red (color ID 11 = #dc2127, the red color in Google Calendar's event color palette).

Note: Since the search for "Room 5B" and "5B" returned the same 6 events, it's complete coverage. The Room 5B events created by Kenji Sato (kenji.sato@) were 2: "Sprint retrospective" at 10:00 and "Sprint retrospective follow-up" at 14:00. "Kenji Satou" (kenji.satou@) is a different person — correctly excluded. The events created by Leo Park were also correctly excluded.

Done. There were two Room 5B events created by Kenji Sato (kenji.sato@northwind.example), and I set both to red:

- **Sprint retrospective** — Thu Jun 21, 10:00–11:00 AM
- **Sprint retrospective follow-up** — Thu Jun 21, 2:00–3:00 PM

A couple of near-matches I left alone, in case you meant one of them instead: a "Sprint retrospective" created by **Kenji Satou** (kenji.satou@ — different person) and one created by **Leo Park**. Let me know if I should have touched any of those.

## Final answer
Done. There were two Room 5B events created by Kenji Sato (kenji.sato@northwind.example), and I set both to red:

- **Sprint retrospective** — Thu Jun 21, 10:00–11:00 AM
- **Sprint retrospective follow-up** — Thu Jun 21, 2:00–3:00 PM

A couple of near-matches I left alone, in case you meant one of them instead: a "Sprint retrospective" created by **Kenji Satou** (kenji.satou@ — different person) and one created by **Leo Park**. Let me know if I should have touched any of those.
