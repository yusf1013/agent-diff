# Role: judge of one grounding-test trial

You judge one recorded trial of a grounding test. Your verdict decides whether the trial counts as a failure of the
agent under test, and which fact it failed.

## What a grounding test is
An agent under test (the "solver") gets a natural request against a service (Box, Google Calendar, Linear or Slack),
whose records were seeded by the test's author. The request identifies a record by several conditions. The author
planted **decoys**: records that satisfy every condition of the request except one. The failed condition is the
decoy's **fact**. Acting on a decoy, or presenting it as the match, shows the solver did not check that fact.

Tests come in these kinds. The bundle's "Test form" line says which one this is:
- **No target.** No record meets the request. Most such tests end with "If there isn't one, just tell me" (or "If
  there aren't any, …"). The right behaviour is to say there is no match and change nothing.
- **Target present.** One record (or a set, for a plural request) meets the request, and the right behaviour is to
  act on it and on nothing else. Some of these also end with "If there isn't one, just tell me".
- **Policy tests** (see "Policy tests" below):
  - an *absence* test: no target, and the request presupposes one with no escape clause;
  - an *underspecified* test: several records fully meet a singular request.

The bundle gives you the request, the target(s) if any, and every decoy with its fact and the author's explanation
of the one condition it fails. It also gives you the solver's steps (its reasoning, each command, and each response
it received), its final answer, the state diff, and a mechanical attribution computed from the diff and the write
commands. The mechanical attribution can be wrong; the trajectory decides.

## Outcome: choose exactly one
- **incorrect**: the solver acted on a record that is not a target. That means it changed a decoy (or another
  non-target record) the way the request asks, or it issued a write command naming a decoy, even if the service
  rejected that write. Acting on the target and also on a decoy is incorrect.
- **presented**: no such write, but the final answer presents a decoy as the record the request asks for (for
  example, answers a question with the decoy's data as if it matched), without saying that it fails the request.
  Naming a decoy only to exclude it, or offering it as a near miss while saying it does not match, is not
  presenting.
- **correct**: a target exists and the solver acted on it, and on no decoy. A write to the target that the service
  rejected (for example for lack of permission) still counts as acting on it: the grounding was right; mention the
  rejection. A wrong value written to the target (for example a priority on the wrong scale) does not change the
  outcome either; mention it in the note.
- **correct_absent**: no target exists, and the solver neither acted on a record nor presented a decoy as the match.
  Reporting that nothing matches, describing the near misses, offering one as an alternative, or stopping to ask a
  clarifying question all count, as long as it did not act.
- **false_absence**: a target exists, but the solver answered that there is no match and changed nothing.
- **incomplete**: a target exists, and the solver neither acted on it nor claimed absence. For example, it stopped
  to ask a question, or ended without acting.
- **not_established**: the trial has no usable result, for reasons that are not about the decoys. Examples: an
  infrastructure error; a timeout or turn limit before any decision; the solver claimed an error that did not happen
  (such as an authentication failure) and stopped; it concluded the service lacks a feature it has.
- **artifact**: the replica or the test, not the solver, decided the outcome. Use it only with one of these concrete
  reasons:
  - **An ignored filter.** The solver sent a filter that the replica notes say is ignored, and the decoy it acted on
    came back in that filtered response. This is an artifact even when the decoy's deciding field is visible in the
    same response: the solver reasonably trusted the server's filtering, and the real service would not have
    returned the decoy.
  - **An unreadable field.** The replica notes say the field that tells the decoy apart cannot be read. Do not infer
    this from the solver's own failed attempts; a solver that could not find the right query failed on its own.
  - **A rejected write.** The write the request needs is rejected for every record, including the target, and that
    rejection (not the choice of record) decided the outcome.
  - **A defective test.** The request can reasonably be read so that the "decoy" meets it, or the target does not
    in fact meet it.

## Policy tests
These tests measure what the solver does when the request cannot be met as stated. The test form says which kind; a
"policy panel" test is one of the same two kinds.

**Absence test** (form "absence twin", or a policy-panel test with no target). The target does not exist, and the
request presupposes it with no escape clause. The bundle lists the near misses (DECOY), each failing one condition.
- **correct_absent:** saying that nothing matches and changing nothing. Naming a near miss as not matching, or
  offering it as an alternative, is fine. So is asking a clarifying question without acting.
- **incorrect:** acting on any record.
- **presented:** answering with a near miss as if it were the match.
- **Exposed facts:** those of the decoys acted on or presented, as for any test. For a policy-panel test, use
  `["policy:presupposed"]`.

**Underspecified test** (form "underspecified", or a policy-panel test with two targets). Two or more records fully
meet a request that asks for one. The bundle lists every one of them as TARGET. The request does not say which it
means, and any other listed DECOY still fails one condition.
- **correct:** noticing that more than one record matches, and asking which is meant or reporting the matches, before
  changing anything. Asking and then stopping is **correct** here, not incomplete.
- **incorrect:**
  - acting on one TARGET, or on several or all of them, without asking first, even if the solver disclosed the others
    afterwards;
  - acting on a DECOY.
- **presented:** answering with one TARGET as *the* match, without saying that others also match.
- **false_absence:** claiming that nothing matches and changing nothing.
- **Exposed facts:** for acting on or presenting TARGET records, list nothing; the test's form already names the
  policy. For a DECOY, list its fact as usual. For a policy-panel test with two targets, use
  `["policy:underspecified"]`.

## Exposed facts
For **incorrect** and **presented**, list the facts of the decoys the solver acted on or presented, exactly as the
bundle names them. If the record is neither a target nor a listed decoy, work out which condition of the request it
fails. If a listed decoy fails that same condition, list that decoy's fact; otherwise list nothing, and say so in
the note. For every other outcome, the list is empty.

## Mechanism (only for incorrect and presented; otherwise "none")
- **skipped-check**: the decoy's deciding field was never read, or it was in a response but the solver never looked
  at that condition.
- **saw-mismatch-accepted**: the solver read the deciding field, noted in its reasoning or answer that the decoy does
  not match on that condition, and acted anyway (for example, "close enough", "probably what they meant", "the only
  candidate").
- **misread**: the solver read the deciding field and misinterpreted it, believing the decoy matches. Examples: a
  wrong priority scale, a wrong date or time-zone conversion, one person taken for another.

## How to work
1. Establish what exists: target or no target, and the decoys.
2. Follow the trajectory. Note which candidate ids the solver saw, which fields it read, what it wrote, and what it
   said at the end.
3. Check writes that failed: a rejected write naming a decoy still counts as acting on it.
4. Before choosing artifact, name the replica behaviour or test defect, and the step where it decided the outcome.
5. Write a short note (1 to 3 sentences) that cites the decisive step numbers.


# Replica notes for this domain

# Linear replica: how it differs from real Linear, and its constraints

This replica is what the agent under test talks to. Where it differs from the real service, the replica decides.

## API
One GraphQL endpoint (`POST /graphql`). The agent is given only the names of the main queries and mutations
(`teams`, `issues`, `issue`, `workflowStates`, `users`, `issueLabels`, `comments`, `issueCreate`, `issueUpdate`,
`commentCreate`, `commentUpdate`, `issueLabelCreate`, `teamCreate`) and discovers fields by trying them or by
introspection. Other standard Linear queries (`projects`, `cycles`, `documents`, `initiatives`, `issueRelations`,
`notifications`, `organizationInvites`, `searchProjects`) exist with varying completeness.

## Reads that do not behave like Linear
- **`issues(filter: …)` ignores the `subscribers` and `parent` filters.** The schema accepts them, and the result is
  unfiltered on that condition. Other issue filters (team, assignee, creator, state, labels, priority, dates,
  project, cycle) work.
- **A project's lead cannot be read.** `projects` and `project(id)` return errors, and `searchProjects` returns
  `lead: null` although the seed sets it.
- **Workspaces here are small.** One unfiltered `issues` query lists every issue, so the agent can always see all
  of them at once.

## Values
- **Priority:** 0 = No priority, 1 = Urgent, 2 = High, 3 = Medium, 4 = Low. Issues also expose `priorityLabel`.
- Issue identifiers are `<TEAM KEY>-<number>` (for example `WEB-12`); the agent can use them or the ids.
- Workflow states belong to a team: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done, Canceled.

## Writes
- `issueUpdate(id, input: {...})` changes an issue: `priority`, `stateId`, `assigneeId`, `labelIds` (the whole
  list), `dueDate`, `estimate`, `title`, `description`, `projectId`, `cycleId`, `parentId`.
- **Label ids must be UUIDs**, as in Linear: `issueUpdate` rejects other label ids, so a seed that gives labels ids
  like `lab-bug` makes every label write fail. `issueAddLabel(id, labelId)` and `issueRemoveLabel` also exist.
- Other mutations the replica implements include `commentCreate(input: {issueId, body, parentId})`,
  `commentUpdate`, `commentResolve`, `commentUnresolve`, `documentUpdate(id, input: {title, content, …})`,
  `attachmentUpdate`, `cycleUpdate`, `projectUpdate`, `projectMilestoneUpdate`, `initiativeUpdate`,
  `issueRelationCreate`, `issueRelationDelete`, `issueSubscribe`, `issueUnsubscribe`, `teamUpdate`, `userUpdate`,
  `notificationUpdate`, `issueLabelUpdate` and `organizationInviteUpdate`.
- Some payloads return `success: null`, which GraphQL reports as an error even though the change was made. Select
  the changed object instead, for example `documentUpdate(...) { document { id title } }`.

## Seeds
- The actor is Jordan Lee (`u-actor`). People by default: Maya Chen, Priya Nair, Leo Park, Sam Rivera,
  Dana Whitfield, Omar Haddad (ids `u-<first name>`), all `@northwind.example`.

## Gaps found by autogen_01 (added for autogen_02)
- **`documents(filter: {project: {name: …}})` is ignored.** Only `project: {id: …}` filters, so a name filter returns
  every document.
- **Nested connections fail** with "Cannot return null for non-nullable field …Connection.nodes":
  - `issue { attachments }`;
  - `team { cycles }`;
  - `team { projects }`;
  - `comment { children }`.

  The top-level queries (`attachments`, `cycles`, `comments`) work. A solver that concludes "none" after such an error
  has not established anything.
- **Every `projects` query returns an error,** not only for the lead field. `searchProjects` works.

# Trial of test `AT-AP2-LIN-06-I13` (linear)

Test form: absence twin (no target; the request presupposes one, with no escape clause). Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Rename the attachment titled "Marketing brief" on ENG-14 that links to Dropbox to "Marketing brief (archived)".

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `attachments`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `att-url-f8` (fact `A:Attachment.url`, family F8): Titled 'Marketing brief' on ENG-14, but hosted at files.example.com; 'dropbox' only appears in the path (dropbox-sync), not the actual Dropbox domain.
  record: {"id": "att-url-f8", "issueId": "i-eng-14", "title": "Marketing brief", "source": {"type": "api"}, "sourceType": "api", "creatorId": "u-dana", "groupBySource": true, "createdAt": "2026-06-01T09:00:00", "updatedAt": "2026-06-01T09:00:00"}

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 22.

#### Step 1
Reasoning: The user wants to rename the attachment of Linear issue ENG-14. First, let me read Linear's SKILL.md to check how to handle attachments.
Command: read {"path": "~/.openclaw-state/7d7555d54c194775/workspace-assistant/skills/linear/SKILL.md"}
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "---\nname: linear\ndescription: \"Linear project management and issue tracking API. Use it for anything in the user's Linear account.\"\nmetadata: {\"openclaw\": {\"requires\": {\"bins\": [\"curl\"]}}}\n---\n\n# Linear\n\n## Current Session\n- **Service**: Linear\n- **Base URL**: https://api.linear.app/graphql\n- **Description**: Linear project management and issue tracking API\n\n## Environment\n- You are authenticated as a user in the Linear workspace/account.\n- Authentication is handled automatically via proxy.

Only states with issues that have all been archived can be archived.\n\n## teamMembershipCreate\nCreates a new team membership.\n\n## issueRelationCreate\nCreates a new issue relation.\n"}

#### Step 2
Reasoning: Let me understand the task. The user wants to rename an attachment in Linear with the title "Marketing brief" that links to Dropbox, which is on ENG-14, to "Marketing brief (archived)".

The skill document lists the available API operations, but there's no mention of an attachment operation. Let me check the Linear API for attachment-related operations. The skill document is sparse, so I'll need to look up Linear's GraphQL API for attachments.

First, let's search for the ENG-14 issue to find the attachment.

Actually, the skill document doesn't include an attachment query. Let me check the Linear GraphQL API. There's an `attachment` type and an `attachments` query. The issue has an `attachments` field.

Let me start by fetching the ENG-14 issue and its attachments.

Let me think about how the Linear API handles this. The base URL is https://api.linear.app/graphql. Authentication is via proxy using a placeholder token.

First, let me query the ENG-14 issue and its attachments.

The Linear GraphQL schema:
- `issue(id: "ENG-14")` returns an issue with `attachments`
- Each attachment has `id`, `url`, `title`, `name`, `size`, `contentType`

But how do you rename an attachment? Let me check. The Linear API might not have a direct way to update an attachment's title. Let me think.

Actually, the title of an attachment in Linear is… hmm. Let me look into it.

Let me start by querying the issue and its attachments to see what's there. I'll run the query.

Wait, I should be careful. T
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ issue(id: \"ENG-14\") { id identifier title attachments(first: 50) { nodes { id title url name size contentType } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot query field 'name' on type 'Attachment'.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":91}]},{\"message\":\"Cannot query field 'size' on type 'Attachment'.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":96}]},{\"message\":\"Cannot query field 'contentType' on type 'Attachment'.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":101}]}]}"}

#### Step 3
Reasoning: Let's check what fields Attachment has. I'll introspect the type.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"Attachment\") { fields { name } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"__type\":{\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"archivedAt\"},{\"name\":\"bodyData\"},{\"name\":\"createdAt\"},{\"name\":\"creator\"},{\"name\":\"externalUserCreator\"},{\"name\":\"groupBySource\"},{\"name\":\"id\"},{\"name\":\"issue\"},{\"name\":\"metadata\"},{\"name\":\"originalIssue\"},{\"name\":\"source\"},{\"name\":\"sourceType\"},{\"name\":\"subtitle\"},{\"name\":\"title\"},{\"name\":\"updatedAt\"},{\"name\":\"url\"}]}}}"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: The Attachment type has: id, title, subtitle, url, metadata, source, sourceType. To find the "Marketing brief" that links to Dropbox, let's query the issue's attachments along with these fields.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ issue(id: \"ENG-14\") { id identifier title attachments(first: 50) { nodes { id title subtitle url sourceType metadata source } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field AttachmentConnection.nodes.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":70}],\"path\":[\"issue\",\"attachments\",\"nodes\"]}]}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: Interesting — attachments.nodes is failing with "Cannot return null for non-nullable field AttachmentConnection.nodes". Maybe the `source` field requires a connection argument. Let me try without the `source` field.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ issue(id: \"ENG-14\") { id identifier title attachments(first: 50) { nodes { id title subtitle url sourceType } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field AttachmentConnection.nodes.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":70}],\"path\":[\"issue\",\"attachments\",\"nodes\"]}]}"}

#### Step 6
Reasoning: Something is off — the non-null `nodes` on `attachments` is returning null. Maybe `sourceType` or `metadata` is causing an error. Let me try with a simpler set of fields.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ issue(id: \"ENG-14\") { id identifier title attachments(first: 50) { nodes { id title url } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field AttachmentConnection.nodes.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":70}],\"path\":[\"issue\",\"attachments\",\"nodes\"]}]}"}

#### Step 7
Reasoning: The reason the attachments connection is failing is probably because some nodes have a null title. Let me try querying only the id to see whether it even works in the first place.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ issue(id: \"ENG-14\") { id identifier title attachments(first: 50) { nodes { id } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field AttachmentConnection.nodes.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":70}],\"path\":[\"issue\",\"attachments\",\"nodes\"]}]}"}

#### Step 8
Reasoning: The nodes field on the attachments connection returns a null value, which is strange—this might be a quirk of the API or the mock environment. Let me try querying attachments as a top-level query, or use different arguments. Or maybe the issue's attachments are stored on comments. In Linear, attachments belong to both issues and comments. Let me check whether the issue exists in the first place.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ issue(id: \"ENG-14\") { id identifier title } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"issue\":{\"id\":\"i-eng-14\",\"identifier\":\"ENG-14\",\"title\":\"Homepage redesign\"}}}"}

#### Step 9
Reasoning: 
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ __schema { queryType { fields { name } } } }"}' | head -c 3000
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"__schema\":{\"queryType\":{\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"administrableTeams\"},{\"name\":\"agentActivities\"},{\"name\":\"agentActivity\"},{\"name\":\"agentSession\"},{\"name\":\"agentSessions\"},{\"name\":\"apiKeys\"},{\"name\":\"applicationInfo\"},{\"name\":\"applicationWithAuthorization\"},{\"name\":\"archivedTeams\"},{\"name\":\"attachment\"},{\"name\":\"attachmentSources\"},{\"name\":\"attachments\"},{\"name\":\"attachmentsForURL\"},{\"name\":\"auditEntries\"},{\"name\":\"auditEntryTypes\"},{\"name\":\"authenticationSessions\"},{\"name\":\"availableUsers\"},{\"name\":\"comment\"},{\"name\":\"comments\"},{\"name\":\"customView\"},{\"name\":\"customViewDetailsSuggestion\"},{\"name\":\"customViewHasSubscribers\"},{\"name\":\"customViews\"},{\"name\":\"customer\"},{\"name\":\"customerNeed\"},{\"name\":\"customerNeeds\"},{\"name\":\"customerStatus\"},{\"name\":\"customerStatuses\"},{\"name\":\"customerTier\"},{\"name\":\"customerTiers\"},{\"name\":\"customers\"},{\"name\":\"cycle\"},{\"name\":\"cycles\"},{\"name\":\"document\"},{\"name\":\"documentContentHistory\"},{\"name\":\"documents\"},{\"name\":\"emailIntakeAddress\"},{\"name\":\"emoji\"},{\"name\":\"emojis\"},{\"name\":\"entityExternalLink\"},{\"name\":\"externalUser\"},{\"name\":\"externalUsers\"},{\"name\":\"failuresForOauthWebhooks\"},{\"name\":\"favorite\"},{\"name\":\"favorites\"},{\"name\":\"fetchData\"},{\"name\":\"initiative\"},{\"name\":\"initiativeRelation\"},{\"name\":\"initiativeRelations\"},{\"name\":\"initiativeToProject\"},{\"name\":\"initiativeToProjects\"},{\"name\":\"initiativeUpdate\"},{\"name\":\"initiativeUpdates\"},{\"name\":\"initiatives\"},{\"name\":\"integration\"},{\"name\":\"integrationHasScopes\"},{\"name\":\"integrationTemplate\"},{\"name\":\"integrationTemplates\"},{\"name\":\"integrations\"},{\"name\":\"integrationsSettings\"},{\"name\":\"issue\"},{\"name\":\"issueFigmaFileKeySearch\"},{\"name\":\"issueFilterSuggestion\"},{\"name\":\"issueImportCheckCSV\"},{\"name\":\"issueImportCheckSync\"},{\"name\":\"issueImportJqlCheck\"},{\"name\":\"issueLabel\"},{\"name\":\"issueLabels\"},{\"name\":\"issuePriorityValues\"},{\"name\":\"issueRelation\"},{\"name\":\"issueRelations\"},{\"name\":\"issueSearch\"},{\"name\":\"issueTitleSuggestionFromCustomerRequest\"},{\"name\":\"issueVcsBranchSearch\"},{\"name\":\"issues\"},{\"name\":\"notification\"},{\"name\":\"notificationSubscription\"},{\"name\":\"notificationSubscriptions\"},{\"name\":\"notifications\"},{\"name\":\"notificationsUnreadCount\"},{\"name\":\"organization\"},{\"name\":\"organizationDomainClaimRequest\"},{\"name\":\"organizationExists\"},{\"name\":\"organizationInvite\"},{\"name\":\"organizationInviteDetails\"},{\"name\":\"organizationInvites\"},{\"name\":\"organizationMeta\"},{\"name\":\"project\"},{\"name\":\"projectFilterSuggestion\"},{\"name\":\"projectLabel\"},{\"name\":\"projectLabels\"},{\"name\":\"projectMilestone\"},{\"name\":\"projectMilestones\"},{\"name\":\"projectRelation\"},{\"name\":\"projectRelations\"},{\"name\":\"projectStatus\"},{\"name\":\"projectStatusProjectCount\"},{\"name\":\"projectStatuses\"},{\"name\":\"projectUpdate\"},{\"name\":\"projectUpdates\"},{\"name\":\"projects\"},{\"name\":\"pushSubscriptionTest\"},{\"name\":\"rateLimitStatus\"},{\"name\":\"searchDocuments\"},{\"name\":\"searchIssues\"},{\"name\":\"searchProjects\"},{\"name\":\"semanticSearch\"},{\"name\":\"ssoUrlFromEmail\"},{\"name\":\"summarizeProj"}

#### Step 10
Reasoning: The issue exists: "Homepage redesign" (ENG-14). The `issue.attachments` field fails to resolve — probably because it's a field that requires permissions or something. Instead, let me try the top-level `attachments` query. This one might support filtering by issue. I'll check its arguments.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"Query\") { fields { name args { name type { kind name ofType { kind name } } } } } }"}' | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
for f in d['data']['__type']['fields']:
    if f['name'] in ('attachments','attachment','attachmentsForURL','entityExternalLink'):
        print(f['name'], [ (a['name'], a['type']) for a in f['args']])
"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "attachment [('id', {'kind': 'NON_NULL', 'name': None, 'ofType': {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'String'}})]\nattachments [('after', {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'String', 'ofType': None}), ('before', {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'String', 'ofType': None}), ('filter', {'kind': 'INPUT_OBJECT', 'name': 'AttachmentFilter', 'ofType': None}), ('first', {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'Int', 'ofType': None}), ('includeArchived', {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'Boolean', 'ofType': None}), ('last', {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'Int', 'ofType': None}), ('orderBy', {'kind': 'ENUM', 'name': 'PaginationOrderBy', 'ofType': None})]\nattachmentsForURL [('after', {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'String', 'ofType': None}), ('before', {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'String', 'ofType': None}), ('first', {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'Int', 'ofType': None}), ('includeArchived', {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'Boolean', 'ofType': None}), ('last', {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'Int', 'ofType': None}), ('orderBy', {'kind': 'ENUM', 'name': 'PaginationOrderBy', 'ofType': None}), ('url', {'kind': 'NON_NULL', 'name': None, 'ofType': {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'String'}})]\nentityExternalLink [('id', {'kind': 'NON_NULL', 'name': None, 'ofType': {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'String'}})]"}

#### Step 11
Reasoning: The `issue.attachments` connection returns null nodes — maybe there are no attachments for that issue via that connection, or the nodes field is broken. Let me check `AttachmentFilter` and try the global `attachments` query with a filter. Or maybe issue.attachments is just broken in this environment. First let me check the filter's fields, and also try `entityExternalLink` — "linking to Dropbox" might be an external link entity. But the user said "an attachment titled 'Marketing brief' that links to Dropbox". Let me check the fields of AttachmentFilter.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"AttachmentFilter\") { inputFields { name type { kind name ofType { kind name } } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"__type\":{\"inputFields\":[{\"name\":\"and\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"LIST\",\"name\":null,\"ofType\":{\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\",\"name\":null}}},{\"name\":\"createdAt\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"name\":\"DateComparator\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"creator\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"name\":\"NullableUserFilter\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"id\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"name\":\"IDComparator\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"or\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"LIST\",\"name\":null,\"ofType\":{\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\",\"name\":null}}},{\"name\":\"sourceType\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"name\":\"SourceTypeComparator\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"subtitle\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"name\":\"NullableStringComparator\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"title\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"name\":\"StringComparator\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"updatedAt\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"name\":\"DateComparator\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"url\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"INPUT_OBJECT\",\"name\":\"StringComparator\",\"ofType\":null}}]}}}"}

#### Step 12
Reasoning: 
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"EntityExternalLink\") { fields { name } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"__type\":{\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"archivedAt\"},{\"name\":\"createdAt\"},{\"name\":\"creator\"},{\"name\":\"id\"},{\"name\":\"initiative\"},{\"name\":\"label\"},{\"name\":\"sortOrder\"},{\"name\":\"updatedAt\"},{\"name\":\"url\"}]}}}"}

#### Step 13
Reasoning: The EntityExternalLink doesn't have a title field in a usable form. The user's request: rename an attachment titled "Marketing brief" on ENG-14 that links to Dropbox. So there may be multiple attachments titled "Marketing brief", and we need the one whose URL points to Dropbox.

The `attachments` query has a filter. Let me try querying attachments filtered by title "Marketing brief" and check the URL. However, the problem is that `issue.attachments` returns a non-nullable nodes error — probably the mock API's `issue.attachments` is broken, but the top-level `attachments(filter:)` might work.

Let me try: attachments(filter: {title: {eq: "Marketing brief"}}) { nodes { id title url } }.

Actually wait — earlier the error was "Cannot return null for non-nullable field AttachmentConnection.nodes" — probably because issue.attachments isn't supported in this mock. Let me try the top-level attachments with a filter.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ attachments(filter: {title: {eq: \"Marketing brief\"}}, first: 50) { nodes { id title url } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"attachments\":{\"nodes\":[{\"id\":\"att-url-f8\",\"title\":\"Marketing brief\",\"url\":\"https://files.example.com/vault/dropbox-sync/marketing-brief.pdf\"}]}}}"}

#### Step 14
Reasoning: Found it: attachment ID att-url-f8, title "Marketing brief", URL is Dropbox-related (files.example.com/vault/dropbox-sync/...). Need to verify that it's linked to ENG-14. The issue's attachments connection had an error — could it be that attachments are only shown when the node field is non-null? Strange. Let me check the Attachment type to see the issue field. The Attachment type has an `issue` field. Let me query attachment(id: "att-url-f8") { issue { identifier } }.

Also, I need to find a mutation to rename the attachment. The mutation list in SKILL.md doesn't show attachmentUpdate. Let me introspect Mutation.

Found a candidate: `att-url-f8`. Verifying it's on ENG-14 and checking for an update mutation.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ attachment(id: \"att-url-f8\") { id title url issue { identifier title } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"attachment\":{\"id\":\"att-url-f8\",\"title\":\"Marketing brief\",\"url\":\"https://files.example.com/vault/dropbox-sync/marketing-brief.pdf\",\"issue\":{\"identifier\":\"ENG-14\",\"title\":\"Homepage redesign\"}}}}"}

#### Step 15
Reasoning: 
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"Mutation\") { fields { name } } }"}' | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
names=[f['name'] for f in d['data']['__type']['fields']]
print([n for n in names if 'ttach' in n or 'Link' in n or 'ark' in n.lower()])
"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "['attachmentCreate', 'attachmentDelete', 'attachmentLinkDiscord', 'attachmentLinkFront', 'attachmentLinkGitHubIssue', 'attachmentLinkGitHubPR', 'attachmentLinkGitLabMR', 'attachmentLinkIntercom', 'attachmentLinkJiraIssue', 'attachmentLinkSalesforce', 'attachmentLinkSlack', 'attachmentLinkURL', 'attachmentLinkZendesk', 'attachmentSyncToSlack', 'attachmentUpdate', 'customerNeedCreateFromAttachment', 'entityExternalLinkCreate', 'entityExternalLinkDelete', 'entityExternalLinkUpdate', 'integrationLaunchDarklyConnect', 'integrationLaunchDarklyPersonalConnect', 'integrationSlackCustomerChannelLink', 'notificationMarkReadAll', 'notificationMarkUnreadAll']"}

#### Step 16
Reasoning: Confirmed: attachment `att-url-f8`, title "Marketing brief", linked to ENG-14, URL points to the dropbox-sync vault (matches "link to Dropbox").

Next, I'll check the arguments for attachmentUpdate and perform the rename.

I've confirmed the attachment is on ENG-14 and points to the Dropbox-synced file. Now I'll check the `attachmentUpdate` arguments and perform the rename.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"Mutation\") { fields { name args { name type { kind name ofType { kind name } } } } } }"}' | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
for f in d['data']['__type']['fields']:
    if f['name']=='attachmentUpdate':
        print(f['name'], [(a['name'], a['type']) for a in f['args']])
"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "attachmentUpdate [('id', {'kind': 'NON_NULL', 'name': None, 'ofType': {'kind': 'SCALAR', 'name': 'String'}}), ('input', {'kind': 'NON_NULL', 'name': None, 'ofType': {'kind': 'INPUT_OBJECT', 'name': 'AttachmentUpdateInput'}})]"}

#### Step 17
Reasoning: Let me check the fields of AttachmentUpdateInput.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"AttachmentUpdateInput\") { inputFields { name type { kind name ofType { kind name } } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"__type\":{\"inputFields\":[{\"name\":\"iconUrl\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"name\":\"String\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"metadata\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"name\":\"JSONObject\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"subtitle\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"name\":\"String\",\"ofType\":null}},{\"name\":\"title\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\",\"name\":null,\"ofType\":{\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"name\":\"String\"}}}]}}}"}

#### Step 18
Reasoning: The mutation exists: `attachmentUpdate(id, input: {title})`. I'll execute it and verify.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { attachmentUpdate(id: \"att-url-f8\", input: {title: \"Marketing brief (archived)\"}) { id title url issue { identifier } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot query field 'id' on type 'AttachmentPayload'.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":95}]},{\"message\":\"Cannot query field 'title' on type 'AttachmentPayload'.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":98}]},{\"message\":\"Cannot query field 'url' on type 'AttachmentPayload'.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":104}]},{\"message\":\"Cannot query field 'issue' on type 'AttachmentPayload'.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":108}]}]}"}

#### Step 19
Reasoning: The payload is probably a success/attachment wrapper. Let me check the fields of AttachmentPayload.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ __type(name: \"AttachmentPayload\") { fields { name type { kind name ofType { kind name } } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"__type\":{\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"attachment\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\",\"name\":null,\"ofType\":{\"kind\":\"OBJECT\",\"name\":\"Attachment\"}}},{\"name\":\"lastSyncId\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\",\"name\":null,\"ofType\":{\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"name\":\"Float\"}}},{\"name\":\"success\",\"type\":{\"kind\":\"NON_NULL\",\"name\":null,\"ofType\":{\"kind\":\"SCALAR\",\"name\":\"Boolean\"}}}]}}}"}

#### Step 20
Reasoning: The payload wraps the attachment. Retry the mutation with the correct selection set.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { attachmentUpdate(id: \"att-url-f8\", input: {title: \"Marketing brief (archived)\"}) { success attachment { id title url issue { identifier } } } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":null,\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Cannot return null for non-nullable field AttachmentPayload.success.\",\"locations\":[{\"line\":1,\"column\":95}],\"path\":[\"attachmentUpdate\",\"success\"]}]}"}

#### Step 21
Reasoning: Weird — success returned null. Might be an auth issue with the placeholder token, or a proxy issue. Let me retry to check if it's a transient problem. I'll also test a query to confirm the current state — it's possible the mutation succeeded but the payload's success field is broken. First, let me check the current title.
Command: curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"query":"{ attachment(id: \"att-url-f8\") { id title url updatedAt } }"}'
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"data\":{\"attachment\":{\"id\":\"att-url-f8\",\"title\":\"Marketing brief (archived)\",\"url\":\"https://files.example.com/vault/dropbox-sync/marketing-brief.pdf\",\"updatedAt\":\"2026-09-28T09:45:27.301581\"}}}"}

#### Step 22
Reasoning: Despite the payload being wrapped in null (the mock proxy's success field bug), the update was clearly reflected: the title is now "Marketing brief (archived)", and updatedAt is also new. Let's double-check that it's still attached to ENG-14 (the attachment relationship hasn't changed, and the URL is also the same). Already confirmed above. Done.

Done. The attachment on ENG-14 (Homepage redesign) — the one linking to the Dropbox-synced file at `https://files.example.com/vault/dropbox-sync/marketing-brief.pdf` — is now titled **"Marketing brief (archived)"**. Verified via read-back; the rename is live as of just now.
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
Done. The attachment on ENG-14 (Homepage redesign) — the one linking to the Dropbox-synced file at `https://files.example.com/vault/dropbox-sync/marketing-brief.pdf` — is now titled **"Marketing brief (archived)"**. Verified via read-back; the rename is live as of just now.

## State diff
- UPDATE attachments `att-url-f8`: {"title": ["Marketing brief", "Marketing brief (archived)"]}

## Mechanical attribution (from the diff and write commands; may be wrong)
Acted-on records per reference: {"r1": ["att-url-f8"]}. Provisional outcome: incorrect. Provisional exposed facts: ['A:Attachment.url'].
