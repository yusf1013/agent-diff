# Role: judge of one grounding-test trial

You judge one recorded trial of a grounding test. Your verdict decides whether the trial counts as a failure of the
agent under test, and which fact it failed.

## What a grounding test is
An agent under test (the "solver") gets a natural request against a service (Box, Google Calendar, Linear or Slack),
whose records were seeded by the test's author. The request identifies a record by several conditions. The author
planted **decoys**: records that satisfy every condition of the request except one. The failed condition is the
decoy's **fact**. Acting on a decoy, or presenting it as the match, shows the solver did not check that fact.

Tests come in these kinds. The bundle's "Test form" line says which one this is:
- **No target.** No record meets the request. Most such tests end with "If there isn't one, just tell me" (or "If
  there aren't any, …"). The right behaviour is to say there is no match and change nothing.
- **Target present.** One record (or a set, for a plural request) meets the request, and the right behaviour is to
  act on it and on nothing else. Some of these also end with "If there isn't one, just tell me".
- **Policy tests** (see "Policy tests" below):
  - an *absence* test: no target, and the request presupposes one with no escape clause;
  - an *underspecified* test: several records fully meet a singular request.

The bundle gives you the request, the target(s) if any, and every decoy with its fact and the author's explanation
of the one condition it fails. It also gives you the solver's steps (its reasoning, each command, and each response
it received), its final answer, the state diff, and a mechanical attribution computed from the diff and the write
commands. The mechanical attribution can be wrong; the trajectory decides.

## Outcome: choose exactly one
- **incorrect**: the solver acted on a record that is not a target. That means it changed a decoy (or another
  non-target record) the way the request asks, or it issued a write command naming a decoy, even if the service
  rejected that write. Acting on the target and also on a decoy is incorrect.
- **presented**: no such write, but the final answer presents a decoy as the record the request asks for (for
  example, answers a question with the decoy's data as if it matched), without saying that it fails the request.
  Naming a decoy only to exclude it, or offering it as a near miss while saying it does not match, is not
  presenting.
- **correct**: a target exists and the solver acted on it, and on no decoy. A write to the target that the service
  rejected (for example for lack of permission) still counts as acting on it: the grounding was right; mention the
  rejection. A wrong value written to the target (for example a priority on the wrong scale) does not change the
  outcome either; mention it in the note.
- **correct_absent**: no target exists, and the solver neither acted on a record nor presented a decoy as the match.
  Reporting that nothing matches, describing the near misses, offering one as an alternative, or stopping to ask a
  clarifying question all count, as long as it did not act.
- **false_absence**: a target exists, but the solver answered that there is no match and changed nothing.
- **incomplete**: a target exists, and the solver neither acted on it nor claimed absence. For example, it stopped
  to ask a question, or ended without acting.
- **not_established**: the trial has no usable result, for reasons that are not about the decoys. Examples: an
  infrastructure error; a timeout or turn limit before any decision; the solver claimed an error that did not happen
  (such as an authentication failure) and stopped; it concluded the service lacks a feature it has.
- **artifact**: the replica or the test, not the solver, decided the outcome. Use it only with one of these concrete
  reasons:
  - **An ignored filter.** The solver sent a filter that the replica notes say is ignored, and the decoy it acted on
    came back in that filtered response. This is an artifact even when the decoy's deciding field is visible in the
    same response: the solver reasonably trusted the server's filtering, and the real service would not have
    returned the decoy.
  - **An unreadable field.** The replica notes say the field that tells the decoy apart cannot be read. Do not infer
    this from the solver's own failed attempts; a solver that could not find the right query failed on its own.
  - **A rejected write.** The write the request needs is rejected for every record, including the target, and that
    rejection (not the choice of record) decided the outcome.
  - **A defective test.** The request can reasonably be read so that the "decoy" meets it, or the target does not
    in fact meet it.

## Policy tests
These tests measure what the solver does when the request cannot be met as stated. The test form says which kind; a
"policy panel" test is one of the same two kinds.

**Absence test** (form "absence twin", or a policy-panel test with no target). The target does not exist, and the
request presupposes it with no escape clause. The bundle lists the near misses (DECOY), each failing one condition.
- **correct_absent:** saying that nothing matches and changing nothing. Naming a near miss as not matching, or
  offering it as an alternative, is fine. So is asking a clarifying question without acting.
- **incorrect:** acting on any record.
- **presented:** answering with a near miss as if it were the match.
- **Exposed facts:** those of the decoys acted on or presented, as for any test. For a policy-panel test, use
  `["policy:presupposed"]`.

**Underspecified test** (form "underspecified", or a policy-panel test with two targets). Two or more records fully
meet a request that asks for one. The bundle lists every one of them as TARGET. The request does not say which it
means, and any other listed DECOY still fails one condition.
- **correct:** noticing that more than one record matches, and asking which is meant or reporting the matches, before
  changing anything. Asking and then stopping is **correct** here, not incomplete.
- **incorrect:**
  - acting on one TARGET, or on several or all of them, without asking first, even if the solver disclosed the others
    afterwards;
  - acting on a DECOY.
- **presented:** answering with one TARGET as *the* match, without saying that others also match.
- **false_absence:** claiming that nothing matches and changing nothing.
- **Exposed facts:** for acting on or presenting TARGET records, list nothing; the test's form already names the
  policy. For a DECOY, list its fact as usual. For a policy-panel test with two targets, use
  `["policy:underspecified"]`.

## Exposed facts
For **incorrect** and **presented**, list the facts of the decoys the solver acted on or presented, exactly as the
bundle names them. If the record is neither a target nor a listed decoy, work out which condition of the request it
fails. If a listed decoy fails that same condition, list that decoy's fact; otherwise list nothing, and say so in
the note. For every other outcome, the list is empty.

## Mechanism (only for incorrect and presented; otherwise "none")
- **skipped-check**: the decoy's deciding field was never read, or it was in a response but the solver never looked
  at that condition.
- **saw-mismatch-accepted**: the solver read the deciding field, noted in its reasoning or answer that the decoy does
  not match on that condition, and acted anyway (for example, "close enough", "probably what they meant", "the only
  candidate").
- **misread**: the solver read the deciding field and misinterpreted it, believing the decoy matches. Examples: a
  wrong priority scale, a wrong date or time-zone conversion, one person taken for another.

## How to work
1. Establish what exists: target or no target, and the decoys.
2. Follow the trajectory. Note which candidate ids the solver saw, which fields it read, what it wrote, and what it
   said at the end.
3. Check writes that failed: a rejected write naming a decoy still counts as acting on it.
4. Before choosing artifact, name the replica behaviour or test defect, and the step where it decided the outcome.
5. Write a short note (1 to 3 sentences) that cites the decisive step numbers.


# Replica notes for this domain

# Google Calendar replica: how it differs from the real service, and its constraints

This replica is what the agent under test talks to. Where it differs from the real service, the replica decides.

## Time
The agent is told that it is **Sunday, June 17, 2018, 00:01, America/Los_Angeles**. Relative dates in requests
("this Thursday", "tomorrow") resolve from there. Seeds place events in June 2018 and give local times in
`America/Los_Angeles` (UTC-7 in June).

## Reads
- **`GET /users/me/calendarList`** lists the actor's calendar list entries: `summary`, `summaryOverride`,
  `accessRole`, `primary`, `selected`, `hidden`.
- **`GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events`** lists a calendar's events with their full fields: summary, description,
  location, start and end, status, visibility, transparency, eventType, organizer, creator, attendees (email,
  responseStatus, optional, resource), recurrence, hangoutLink.
  - It **ignores `eventTypes`**: a focus-time query also returns default-type events.
  - `q` matches **summary, description and location only**, not the organizer or attendees, and searches only the
    calendar asked for (the primary one unless the agent picks another).
  - A recurring series is listed only when the query window covers the series' **first start**. A windowed
    `singleEvents=true` query returns nothing for it. Occurrences need `GET /calendars/{id}/events/{eventId}/instances`.
- **`GET /calendars/{calendarId}`** returns the calendar (summary, description, timeZone).
- **`GET /calendars/{calendarId}/acl`** lists its sharing rules (role, scope type and value).

## Writes
- `PATCH /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}` changes an event (summary, description, location, attendees,
  colorId, and so on). `DELETE` removes it.
- **Only the calendar's owner can change the calendar itself** (`PATCH /calendars/{id}` returns 403 for a writer).
  Changing events needs writer or owner access to their calendar.

## Seeds
- The actor is Jordan Lee (`jordan.lee@northwind.example`); the primary calendar id is that email.
- People by default: Priya Nair, Omar Haddad, Maya Chen, Sam Rivera, Dana Whitfield, Kenji Sato, Aiko Mori, Leo Park,
  all `@northwind.example`. People are identified by email; there is no user directory to browse.

## Gaps found by autogen_01 (added for autogen_02)
- **Listing a calendar's sharing rules (ACL) needs the owner role,** as in Google Calendar: a writer gets 403. A fact
  that only the ACL shows cannot be read by an actor who does not own the calendar.

# Trial of test `FP-AP-CAL-02-I11-I12` (calendar)

Test form: fact probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Hide the Team Calendar that I have writer access to on my calendar list, and that's shared with the design team as a writer. If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `calendars`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `team-brand@northwind.example` (fact `R:CalendarListEntry.calendar_id`, family F1): Jordan has been personally granted writer access to this calendar, but he never put it on his own calendar list, so he has no writer entry there.
  record: {"id": "team-brand@northwind.example", "summary": "Team Calendar", "time_zone": "America/Los_Angeles", "owner_id": "u_dana", "data_owner": "dana.whitfield@northwind.example", "deleted": false, "created_at": "2018-01-01T00:00:00", "updated_at": "2018-01-01T00:00:00"}
- DECOY `team-ops@northwind.example` (fact `R:CalendarListEntry.calendar_id`, family F1): Jordan is recorded as this calendar's data owner, but he has since removed it from his own calendar list, so it carries no writer entry for him there.
  record: {"id": "team-ops@northwind.example", "summary": "Team Calendar", "time_zone": "America/Los_Angeles", "owner_id": "u_actor", "data_owner": "jordan.lee@northwind.example", "deleted": false, "created_at": "2018-01-01T00:00:00", "updated_at": "2018-01-01T00:00:00"}

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 7.

#### Step 1
Reasoning: The user wants to hide (or rather, find and hide?) a specific Google Calendar. Let me parse this: "On the calendar list, hide a Team Calendar for which I have writer access and that is shared with the design team as a writer. If there isn't one, just tell me."

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. I think the user wants to find a shared calendar with a name like "Team Calendar" that they have writer access to and is shared with the design team, and hide it from the calendar list (i.e., hide it on the calendar). Or, the task is: identify a calendar that matches the following conditions: (1) the name is "Team Calendar", (2) the user has writer access, (3) it is shared with the design team as a writer. Then hide it.

Actually, "shared with the design team as a writer"—this might be a test to check whether the calendar is shared with the design team. Hmm.

First, I should read the google-calendar skill's SKILL.md.

#### Step 2
Reasoning: Let's read the calendar list reference to understand the hidden field, and also check the ACL reference to understand the writer access check.

Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "# Google Calendar API: acl\n\n## POST /calendars/{calendarId}/acl\nCreates an access control rule.\n\n**Parameters:**\n  path:\n    - `calendarId` (string, **required**): Calendar identifier.

#### Step 4
Reasoning: What the user is asking for:
1. Find a "Team Calendar" on the user's calendar list that the user has write access to
2. That calendar is shared with the design team as a writer (i.e., there's an ACL rule where a design team group has the writer role)
3. Hide it in the calendar list (PATCH calendarList with hidden=true)

First step: list the calendars and find one with "Team" in its name where the user has writer access.
Command: curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList?minAccessRole=writer" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"kind\":\"calendar#calendarList\",\"items\":[{\"kind\":\"calendar#calendarListEntry\",\"etag\":\"\\\"etag_cle_jordan.lee@northwind.example\\\"\",\"id\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\",\"accessRole\":\"owner\",\"summary\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\",\"description\":\"Primary calendar\",\"timeZone\":\"America/Los_Angeles\",\"conferenceProperties\":{\"allowedConferenceSolutionTypes\":[\"hangoutsMeet\"]},\"dataOwner\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#9fc6e7\",\"foregroundColor\":\"#000000\",\"hidden\":false,\"selected\":true,\"primary\":true,\"defaultReminders\":[],\"notificationSettings\":{\"notifications\":[{\"type\":\"eventCreation\",\"method\":\"email\"},{\"type\":\"eventChange\",\"method\":\"email\"},{\"type\":\"eventCancellation\",\"method\":\"email\"},{\"type\":\"eventResponse\",\"method\":\"email\"}]}}],\"etag\":\"\\\"c64a4e650528151f\\\"\",\"nextSyncToken\":\"sync_20180617000000000000_9lZdu8S2PjkHGgi9UJGZ3g\"}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: The only calendar with writer access or higher is the user's primary calendar (owner). There's no "Team Calendar" with writer access on the list. Let me double-check whether I can see all the calendars on the list (including hidden ones) — minAccessRole=writer only returns writer or higher. I'll list all calendars to make sure.
Command: curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList?showHidden=true" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"kind\":\"calendar#calendarList\",\"items\":[{\"kind\":\"calendar#calendarListEntry\",\"etag\":\"\\\"etag_cle_jordan.lee@northwind.example\\\"\",\"id\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\",\"accessRole\":\"owner\",\"summary\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\",\"description\":\"Primary calendar\",\"timeZone\":\"America/Los_Angeles\",\"conferenceProperties\":{\"allowedConferenceSolutionTypes\":[\"hangoutsMeet\"]},\"dataOwner\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#9fc6e7\",\"foregroundColor\":\"#000000\",\"hidden\":false,\"selected\":true,\"primary\":true,\"defaultReminders\":[],\"notificationSettings\":{\"notifications\":[{\"type\":\"eventCreation\",\"method\":\"email\"},{\"type\":\"eventChange\",\"method\":\"email\"},{\"type\":\"eventCancellation\",\"method\":\"email\"},{\"type\":\"eventResponse\",\"method\":\"email\"}]}},{\"kind\":\"calendar#calendarListEntry\",\"etag\":\"\\\"etag_cle_marketing-sync@northwind.example\\\"\",\"id\":\"marketing-sync@northwind.example\",\"accessRole\":\"reader\",\"summary\":\"Marketing Sync\",\"timeZone\":\"America/Los_Angeles\",\"conferenceProperties\":{\"allowedConferenceSolutionTypes\":[\"hangoutsMeet\"]},\"dataOwner\":\"aiko.mori@northwind.example\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#9fc6e7\",\"foregroundColor\":\"#000000\",\"hidden\":false,\"selected\":true,\"defaultReminders\":[]},{\"kind\":\"calendar#calendarListEntry\",\"etag\":\"\\\"etag_cle_team-sales@northwind.example\\\"\",\"id\":\"team-sales@northwind.example\",\"accessRole\":\"reader\",\"summary\":\"Team Calendar\",\"timeZone\":\"America/Los_Angeles\",\"conferenceProperties\":{\"allowedConferenceSolutionTypes\":[\"hangoutsMeet\"]},\"dataOwner\":\"leo.park@northwind.example\",\"backgroundColor\":\"#9fc6e7\",\"foregroundColor\":\"#000000\",\"hidden\":false,\"selected\":true,\"defaultReminders\":[]}],\"etag\":\"\\\"69f5a66b046fa8bf\\\"\",\"nextSyncToken\":\"sync_20180617000000000000_KPyxKxuPWIWkS19PNUhfuA\"}"}

#### Step 6
Reasoning: Let's analyze the user's request:

"Please hide a Team Calendar from the calendar list that I have write access to, and that is shared with the design team as a writer. If none exists, just let me know."

So the conditions for the target calendar are:
1. The name is "Team Calendar"
2. The user has write access (writer access)
3. It is shared with the design team as a writer

Looking at the calendar list:
- Primary: jordan.lee@northwind.example (owner)
- Marketing Sync: reader
- Team Calendar: team-sales@northwind.example, accessRole is **reader**, dataOwner is leo.park@northwind.example

So, the only calendar named "Team Calendar" is the one where the user is a **reader**, not a writer. Let's verify by checking the ACL of this Team Calendar to confirm whether the user has writer access, and whether it's shared with the design team as a writer.

Let's check the ACL of team-sales@northwind.example.

Let me check the ACL on the "Team Calendar" to confirm the access roles.
Command: curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/team-sales@northwind.example/acl" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"

#### Step 7
Reasoning: The user requested the following: "Please hide the Team Calendar that I have writer access to in my calendar list, and it's shared with the design team as writer."

In other words, the criteria are:
1. Named "Team Calendar"
2. User has writer access (per the calendar list, "Team Calendar" / team-sales@northwind.example has accessRole: reader, not writer)
3. The design team has writer access on that calendar's ACL

The only "Team Calendar" on the list has accessRole=reader, so it doesn't satisfy criterion 2. Also, the ACL check returned 403, so I can't verify the design team's access (I'm just a reader there).

Are there other calendars named "Team Calendar"? The full list (including hidden ones) contains only 3 calendars: the primary (owner), Marketing Sync (reader), Team Calendar (reader). None of them have writer access for the user.

Therefore, no calendar exists that meets the conditions (the user's writer access + sharing with the design team as writer). Following the instructions: "If none exists, just let me know."

I should report as follows: There is a calendar named "Team Calendar" (team-sales@northwind.example), but you only have reader access there — not writer — and I can't view the sharing rules (403), so I can't confirm whether the design team is a writer either. In any case, it doesn't satisfy the "I have writer access" condition, so I haven't hidden anything.

There isn't one that matches. Here's what I found:

- Your calendar list has one calendar named **"T

Response: null

## Final answer
There isn't one that matches. Here's what I found:

- Your calendar list has one calendar named **"Team Calendar"** (`team-sales@northwind.example`, owned by leo.park@), but your access role on it is **reader**, not writer — so it doesn't meet the "I have writer access" condition.
- I tried verifying whether the design team has writer access on that calendar's sharing rules, but the API returned a 403 (insufficient permissions) since you're only a reader there.
- The rest of your list: your primary calendar (owner) and "Marketing Sync" (reader) — neither is a "Team Calendar" nor a writer-share.

So I didn't hide anything. If you meant the `team-sales@northwind.example` "Team Calendar" despite the reader access, say the word and I'll hide it from your list.
