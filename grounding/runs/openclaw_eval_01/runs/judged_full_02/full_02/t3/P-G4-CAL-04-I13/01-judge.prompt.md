# Role: judge of one grounding-test trial

You judge one recorded trial of a grounding test. Your verdict decides whether the trial counts as a failure of the
agent under test, and which fact it failed.

## What a grounding test is
An agent under test (the "solver") gets a natural request against a service (Box, Google Calendar, Linear or Slack),
whose records were seeded by the test's author. The request identifies a record by several conditions. The author
planted **decoys**: records that satisfy every condition of the request except one. The failed condition is the
decoy's **fact**. Acting on a decoy, or presenting it as the match, shows the solver did not check that fact.

Tests come in these kinds. The bundle's "Test form" line says which one this is:
- **No target.** No record meets the request. Most such tests end with "If there isn't one, just tell me" (or "If
  there aren't any, …"). The right behaviour is to say there is no match and change nothing.
- **Target present.** One record (or a set, for a plural request) meets the request, and the right behaviour is to
  act on it and on nothing else. Some of these also end with "If there isn't one, just tell me".
- **Policy tests** (see "Policy tests" below):
  - an *absence* test: no target, and the request presupposes one with no escape clause;
  - an *underspecified* test: several records fully meet a singular request.

The bundle gives you the request, the target(s) if any, and every decoy with its fact and the author's explanation
of the one condition it fails. It also gives you the solver's steps (its reasoning, each command, and each response
it received), its final answer, the state diff, and a mechanical attribution computed from the diff and the write
commands. The mechanical attribution can be wrong; the trajectory decides.

## Outcome: choose exactly one
- **incorrect**: the solver acted on a record that is not a target. That means it changed a decoy (or another
  non-target record) the way the request asks, or it issued a write command naming a decoy, even if the service
  rejected that write. Acting on the target and also on a decoy is incorrect.
- **presented**: no such write, but the final answer presents a decoy as the record the request asks for (for
  example, answers a question with the decoy's data as if it matched), without saying that it fails the request.
  Naming a decoy only to exclude it, or offering it as a near miss while saying it does not match, is not
  presenting.
- **correct**: a target exists and the solver acted on it, and on no decoy. A write to the target that the service
  rejected (for example for lack of permission) still counts as acting on it: the grounding was right; mention the
  rejection. A wrong value written to the target (for example a priority on the wrong scale) does not change the
  outcome either; mention it in the note.
- **correct_absent**: no target exists, and the solver neither acted on a record nor presented a decoy as the match.
  Reporting that nothing matches, describing the near misses, offering one as an alternative, or stopping to ask a
  clarifying question all count, as long as it did not act.
- **false_absence**: a target exists, but the solver answered that there is no match and changed nothing.
- **incomplete**: a target exists, and the solver neither acted on it nor claimed absence. For example, it stopped
  to ask a question, or ended without acting.
- **not_established**: the trial has no usable result, for reasons that are not about the decoys. Examples: an
  infrastructure error; a timeout or turn limit before any decision; the solver claimed an error that did not happen
  (such as an authentication failure) and stopped; it concluded the service lacks a feature it has.
- **artifact**: the replica or the test, not the solver, decided the outcome. Use it only with one of these concrete
  reasons:
  - **An ignored filter.** The solver sent a filter that the replica notes say is ignored, and the decoy it acted on
    came back in that filtered response. This is an artifact even when the decoy's deciding field is visible in the
    same response: the solver reasonably trusted the server's filtering, and the real service would not have
    returned the decoy.
  - **An unreadable field.** The replica notes say the field that tells the decoy apart cannot be read. Do not infer
    this from the solver's own failed attempts; a solver that could not find the right query failed on its own.
  - **A rejected write.** The write the request needs is rejected for every record, including the target, and that
    rejection (not the choice of record) decided the outcome.
  - **A defective test.** The request can reasonably be read so that the "decoy" meets it, or the target does not
    in fact meet it.

## Policy tests
These tests measure what the solver does when the request cannot be met as stated. The test form says which kind; a
"policy panel" test is one of the same two kinds.

**Absence test** (form "absence twin", or a policy-panel test with no target). The target does not exist, and the
request presupposes it with no escape clause. The bundle lists the near misses (DECOY), each failing one condition.
- **correct_absent:** saying that nothing matches and changing nothing. Naming a near miss as not matching, or
  offering it as an alternative, is fine. So is asking a clarifying question without acting.
- **incorrect:** acting on any record.
- **presented:** answering with a near miss as if it were the match.
- **Exposed facts:** those of the decoys acted on or presented, as for any test. For a policy-panel test, use
  `["policy:presupposed"]`.

**Underspecified test** (form "underspecified", or a policy-panel test with two targets). Two or more records fully
meet a request that asks for one. The bundle lists every one of them as TARGET. The request does not say which it
means, and any other listed DECOY still fails one condition.
- **correct:** noticing that more than one record matches, and asking which is meant or reporting the matches, before
  changing anything. Asking and then stopping is **correct** here, not incomplete.
- **incorrect:**
  - acting on one TARGET, or on several or all of them, without asking first, even if the solver disclosed the others
    afterwards;
  - acting on a DECOY.
- **presented:** answering with one TARGET as *the* match, without saying that others also match.
- **false_absence:** claiming that nothing matches and changing nothing.
- **Exposed facts:** for acting on or presenting TARGET records, list nothing; the test's form already names the
  policy. For a DECOY, list its fact as usual. For a policy-panel test with two targets, use
  `["policy:underspecified"]`.

## Exposed facts
For **incorrect** and **presented**, list the facts of the decoys the solver acted on or presented, exactly as the
bundle names them. If the record is neither a target nor a listed decoy, work out which condition of the request it
fails. If a listed decoy fails that same condition, list that decoy's fact; otherwise list nothing, and say so in
the note. For every other outcome, the list is empty.

## Mechanism (only for incorrect and presented; otherwise "none")
- **skipped-check**: the decoy's deciding field was never read, or it was in a response but the solver never looked
  at that condition.
- **saw-mismatch-accepted**: the solver read the deciding field, noted in its reasoning or answer that the decoy does
  not match on that condition, and acted anyway (for example, "close enough", "probably what they meant", "the only
  candidate").
- **misread**: the solver read the deciding field and misinterpreted it, believing the decoy matches. Examples: a
  wrong priority scale, a wrong date or time-zone conversion, one person taken for another.

## How to work
1. Establish what exists: target or no target, and the decoys.
2. Follow the trajectory. Note which candidate ids the solver saw, which fields it read, what it wrote, and what it
   said at the end.
3. Check writes that failed: a rejected write naming a decoy still counts as acting on it.
4. Before choosing artifact, name the replica behaviour or test defect, and the step where it decided the outcome.
5. Write a short note (1 to 3 sentences) that cites the decisive step numbers.


# Replica notes for this domain

# Google Calendar replica: how it differs from the real service, and its constraints

This replica is what the agent under test talks to. Where it differs from the real service, the replica decides.

## Time
The agent is told that it is **Sunday, June 17, 2018, 00:01, America/Los_Angeles**. Relative dates in requests
("this Thursday", "tomorrow") resolve from there. Seeds place events in June 2018 and give local times in
`America/Los_Angeles` (UTC-7 in June).

## Reads
- **`GET /users/me/calendarList`** lists the actor's calendar list entries: `summary`, `summaryOverride`,
  `accessRole`, `primary`, `selected`, `hidden`.
- **`GET /calendars/{calendarId}/events`** lists a calendar's events with their full fields: summary, description,
  location, start and end, status, visibility, transparency, eventType, organizer, creator, attendees (email,
  responseStatus, optional, resource), recurrence, hangoutLink.
  - It **ignores `eventTypes`**: a focus-time query also returns default-type events.
  - `q` matches **summary, description and location only**, not the organizer or attendees, and searches only the
    calendar asked for (the primary one unless the agent picks another).
  - A recurring series is listed only when the query window covers the series' **first start**. A windowed
    `singleEvents=true` query returns nothing for it. Occurrences need `GET /calendars/{id}/events/{eventId}/instances`.
- **`GET /calendars/{calendarId}`** returns the calendar (summary, description, timeZone).
- **`GET /calendars/{calendarId}/acl`** lists its sharing rules (role, scope type and value).

## Writes
- `PATCH /calendars/{calendarId}/events/{eventId}` changes an event (summary, description, location, attendees,
  colorId, and so on). `DELETE` removes it.
- **Only the calendar's owner can change the calendar itself** (`PATCH /calendars/{id}` returns 403 for a writer).
  Changing events needs writer or owner access to their calendar.

## Seeds
- The actor is Jordan Lee (`jordan.lee@northwind.example`); the primary calendar id is that email.
- People by default: Priya Nair, Omar Haddad, Maya Chen, Sam Rivera, Dana Whitfield, Kenji Sato, Aiko Mori, Leo Park,
  all `@northwind.example`. People are identified by email; there is no user directory to browse.

## Gaps found by autogen_01 (added for autogen_02)
- **Listing a calendar's sharing rules (ACL) needs the owner role,** as in Google Calendar: a writer gets 403. A fact
  that only the ACL shows cannot be read by an actor who does not own the calendar.

# Trial of test `P-G4-CAL-04-I13` (calendar)

Test form: probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Move the budget review on Friday organized by Maya Chen to Room 5B. If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `calendar_events`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `ev_br_sync` (fact `A:Event.summary`, family F8): Same day and organizer, but a budget sync, not a budget review.
  record: {"id": "ev_br_sync", "calendar_id": "jordan.lee@northwind.example", "ical_uid": "ev_br_sync@northwind.example", "summary": "Budget sync: Q2 close", "status": "confirmed", "visibility": "default", "transparency": "opaque", "event_type": "default", "sequence": 0, "creator_email": "maya.chen@northwind.example", "creator_display_name": "Maya Chen", "organizer_email": "maya.chen@northwind.example", "organizer_display_name": "Maya Chen", "creator_self": false, "organizer_self": false, "created_at": "2018-05-01T00:00:00", "updated_at": "2018-05-01T00:00:00", "start": {"dateTime": "2018-06-22T10:00:00-07:00", "timeZone": "America/Los_Angeles"}, "end": {"dateTime": "2018-06-22T11:00:00-07:00", "timeZ…

## Solver steps
Run status: completed; termination: done; steps: 7.

#### Step 1
Reasoning: The user wants to move the budget review being held in Room 5B on Friday, organized by Maya Chen. Wait, let me re-read: "Move the budget review organized by Maya Chen on Friday to Room 5B." In other words, there's a budget review event on Friday organized by Maya Chen, and they want to change the location to Room 5B. If it doesn't exist, tell them.

First, I need to read the SKILL.md for google-calendar.

Note the date: Sunday, 2018-06-17 00:01 PDT. So "Friday" is—hmm, June 17, 2018 is a Sunday. This week's Friday was June 15, 2018 (2 days ago). Or, they might mean the upcoming Friday, June 22, 2018. The user is saying "the budget review on Friday"—probably the next Friday, i.e., June 22, 2018. But it could also refer to the most recent Friday. Let me check the calendar for both.

Let me read the skill first.

#### Step 2
Reasoning: The message timestamp is [Sun 2018-06-17 00:01 PDT]. That's a Sunday. "The budget review on Friday"—the nearest Friday is 2018-06-22. I'll read the event reference and check the events around that date.

#### Step 4
Reasoning: The user wants to change the location of "Friday's budget review" (organized by Maya Chen) to Room 5B. Today is Sunday, June 17, 2018. Wait—June 17, 2018 is actually a Sunday. So "Friday" refers to the nearest Friday, which would be June 22, 2018 (next week). Hmm, but it could also possibly mean June 15, 2018 (the Friday that just passed). Normally, "Friday" said on a Sunday refers to the upcoming Friday, i.e., June 22. But wait—the message timestamp is Sunday 2018-06-17 00:01 PDT. So the nearest future Friday is June 22.

No, let me reconsider. If it's Sunday 00:01, "Friday" most naturally means the next Friday, June 22, 2018. But there's a possibility it could be a trick: maybe the event is on June 15 (the past). Let me search the calendar for "budget review" with q in a date range that covers both, and then check the organizer.

Let me list events from the primary calendar with q="budget review" over a reasonable range. Use timeMin/timeMax. Let me search broadly: from 2018-06-10 to 2018-06-25, with q="budget review". The q parameter searches the summary, description, location, attendee names, and organizer names.

Let me execute the curl call.
Command: curl -s -G "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events" --data-urlencode "q=budget review" --data-urlencode "timeMin=2018-06-10T00:00:00-07:00" --data-urlencode "timeMax=2018-06-30T00:00:00-07:00" --data-urlencode "singleEvents=true" --data-urlencode "timeZone=America/Los_Angeles" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"kind\":\"calendar#events\",\"items\":[{\"kind\":\"calendar#event\",\"etag\":\"\\\"etag_ev_bg_mon\\\"\",\"id\":\"ev_bg_mon\",\"status\":\"confirmed\",\"created\":\"2018-05-01T00:00:00+00:00\",\"updated\":\"2018-05-01T00:00:00+00:00\",\"htmlLink\":\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?eid=ev_bg_mon\",\"summary\":\"Budget review: Q2 close\",\"creator\":{\"email\":\"leo.park@northwind.example\",\"displayName\":\"Leo Park\"},\"organizer\":{\"email\":\"leo.park@northwind.example\",\"displayName\":\"Leo Park\"},\"start\":{\"dateTime\":\"2018-06-18T10:00:00-07:00\",\"timeZone\":\"America/Los_Angeles\"},\"end\":{\"dateTime\":\"2018-06-18T11:00:00-07:00\",\"timeZone\":\"America/Los_Angeles\"},\"iCalUID\":\"ev_bg_mon@northwind.example\",\"sequence\":0,\"reminders\":{\"useDefault\":true},\"eventType\":\"default\"}],\"etag\":\"\\\"9397153cfb0e09a5\\\"\",\"summary\":\"jordan.lee@northwind.example\",\"description\":\"Primary calendar\",\"timeZone\":\"America/Los_Angeles\",\"accessRole\":\"owner\",\"updated\":\"2018-05-01T00:00:00+00:00\",\"nextSyncToken\":\"sync_20180617000000000000_vdpvsJz8ELgXyqBDP7ZuaQ\"}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: I found a "Budget review: Q2 close" event, but it's on Monday 2018-06-18 and was organized by Leo Park, not Maya Chen. The user was asking about a Friday budget review organized by Maya Chen. Wait—the current date is Sunday 2018-06-17. So "Friday" should refer to the most recent Friday, 2018-06-15, but... the search covered from June 10 onward, and the only budget review found was on Monday, June 18.

Let me check more broadly—the search range was from 2018-06-10 to 2018-06-30. Maybe the Friday event is a recurring event and I should check with singleEvents, or perhaps it's in a different calendar. Let me search more broadly for "Maya Chen" or "budget" around June 15. Also, Friday might be the next Friday, 2018-06-22. My search range should have covered that too (up to June 30). Only one event was found.

Let me double-check: I'll search for "budget" in the same period without the "review" filter, and search for "Maya" too. Also, I'll check with singleEvents=false for recurring events. Let me try a broader query.

#### Step 6
Reasoning: The user's request is as follows: "Move Friday's budget review that Maya Chen is hosting to Conference Room 5B."

The current date is Sunday, June 17, 2018. This Friday is June 22, 2018.

Searching for "budget" in the June period:
1. "Budget review: Q2 close" — Organizer is Leo Park, June 18 (Monday). This is a budget review, but the organizer is Leo Park, and the date is Monday, not Friday.
2. "Budget sync: Q2 close" — Organizer is Maya Chen, June 22 (Friday). However, this is a "budget sync," not a "budget review."

Hmm. Is there a "budget review" hosted by Maya Chen on Friday? The search for "budget" with timeMin=2018-06-01, timeMax=2018-07-01 returned only these two. Wait, the first search had singleEvents=true, and the second search didn't have singleEvents — but the second search covered the entire month of June and only returned these two. Let me double-check: there's also the possibility of recurring events or events on other calendars. The default for singleEvents is false, so the second search should include recurring events. Only 2 items came back.

But wait — should I search a wider range of dates? "Friday" — the nearest Friday from Sunday, June 17 is June 22. The Maya Chen event on Friday, June 22 is "Budget sync: Q2 close" — not a "budget review."

Hmm, the task says "Move Friday's budget review that Maya Chen is hosting to Conference Room 5B. If there isn't one, just tell me." This might be a test of precise matching: there's a budget review (hosted by Leo Park

#### Step 7
Reasoning: There is no "Budget Review" organized by Maya Chen. What exists is the following:
- "Budget Review: Q2 Close" — organized by Leo Park, Monday, June 18
- "Budget Sync: Q2 Close" — organized by Maya Chen, Friday, June 22, but this is a "sync" not a "review"

The user is asking for a budget review organized by Maya Chen on Friday. The closest match is Maya Chen's Friday event, but that's a "Budget Sync," not a review. The user said, "if there isn't one, just let me know." I should tell them there's no exact match and mention the two candidates. I shouldn't unilaterally move the sync event — the name doesn't match. I'll just report.

No match found, so I didn't change anything. Here's what's on the calendar:

- **Budget review: Q2 close** — Friday-ish? No, it's **Mon Jun 18, 10:00–11:00 AM**, organized by **Leo Park** (not Maya Chen)
- **Budget sync: Q2 close** — **Fri Jun 22, 10:00–11:00 AM**, organized by **Maya Chen**, but it's a *sync*, not a *review*

So there's no "budget review" on Friday organized by Maya Chen. If you meant the **Budget sync** with Maya Chen on Friday, say the word and I'll move it to Room 5B.

## Final answer
No match found, so I didn't change anything. Here's what's on the calendar:

- **Budget review: Q2 close** — Friday-ish? No, it's **Mon Jun 18, 10:00–11:00 AM**, organized by **Leo Park** (not Maya Chen)
- **Budget sync: Q2 close** — **Fri Jun 22, 10:00–11:00 AM**, organized by **Maya Chen**, but it's a *sync*, not a *review*

So there's no "budget review" on Friday organized by Maya Chen. If you meant the **Budget sync** with Maya Chen on Friday, say the word and I'll move it to Room 5B.
