# Role: judge of one grounding-test trial

You judge one recorded trial of a grounding test. Your verdict decides whether the trial counts as a failure of the
agent under test, and which fact it failed.

## What a grounding test is
An agent under test (the "solver") gets a natural request against a service (Box, Google Calendar, Linear or Slack),
whose records were seeded by the test's author. The request identifies a record by several conditions. The author
planted **decoys**: records that satisfy every condition of the request except one. The failed condition is the
decoy's **fact**. Acting on a decoy, or presenting it as the match, shows the solver did not check that fact.

Tests come in these kinds. The bundle's "Test form" line says which one this is:
- **No target.** No record meets the request. Most such tests end with "If there isn't one, just tell me" (or "If
  there aren't any, …"). The right behaviour is to say there is no match and change nothing.
- **Target present.** One record (or a set, for a plural request) meets the request, and the right behaviour is to
  act on it and on nothing else. Some of these also end with "If there isn't one, just tell me".
- **Policy tests** (see "Policy tests" below):
  - an *absence* test: no target, and the request presupposes one with no escape clause;
  - an *underspecified* test: several records fully meet a singular request.

The bundle gives you the request, the target(s) if any, and every decoy with its fact and the author's explanation
of the one condition it fails. It also gives you the solver's steps (its reasoning, each command, and each response
it received), its final answer, the state diff, and a mechanical attribution computed from the diff and the write
commands. The mechanical attribution can be wrong; the trajectory decides.

## Outcome: choose exactly one
- **incorrect**: the solver acted on a record that is not a target. That means it changed a decoy (or another
  non-target record) the way the request asks, or it issued a write command naming a decoy, even if the service
  rejected that write. Acting on the target and also on a decoy is incorrect.
- **presented**: no such write, but the final answer presents a decoy as the record the request asks for (for
  example, answers a question with the decoy's data as if it matched), without saying that it fails the request.
  Naming a decoy only to exclude it, or offering it as a near miss while saying it does not match, is not
  presenting.
- **correct**: a target exists and the solver acted on it, and on no decoy. A write to the target that the service
  rejected (for example for lack of permission) still counts as acting on it: the grounding was right; mention the
  rejection. A wrong value written to the target (for example a priority on the wrong scale) does not change the
  outcome either; mention it in the note.
- **correct_absent**: no target exists, and the solver neither acted on a record nor presented a decoy as the match.
  Reporting that nothing matches, describing the near misses, offering one as an alternative, or stopping to ask a
  clarifying question all count, as long as it did not act.
- **false_absence**: a target exists, but the solver answered that there is no match and changed nothing.
- **incomplete**: a target exists, and the solver neither acted on it nor claimed absence. For example, it stopped
  to ask a question, or ended without acting.
- **not_established**: the trial has no usable result, for reasons that are not about the decoys. Examples: an
  infrastructure error; a timeout or turn limit before any decision; the solver claimed an error that did not happen
  (such as an authentication failure) and stopped; it concluded the service lacks a feature it has.
- **artifact**: the replica or the test, not the solver, decided the outcome. Use it only with one of these concrete
  reasons:
  - **An ignored filter.** The solver sent a filter that the replica notes say is ignored, and the decoy it acted on
    came back in that filtered response. This is an artifact even when the decoy's deciding field is visible in the
    same response: the solver reasonably trusted the server's filtering, and the real service would not have
    returned the decoy.
  - **An unreadable field.** The replica notes say the field that tells the decoy apart cannot be read. Do not infer
    this from the solver's own failed attempts; a solver that could not find the right query failed on its own.
  - **A rejected write.** The write the request needs is rejected for every record, including the target, and that
    rejection (not the choice of record) decided the outcome.
  - **A defective test.** The request can reasonably be read so that the "decoy" meets it, or the target does not
    in fact meet it.

## Policy tests
These tests measure what the solver does when the request cannot be met as stated. The test form says which kind; a
"policy panel" test is one of the same two kinds.

**Absence test** (form "absence twin", or a policy-panel test with no target). The target does not exist, and the
request presupposes it with no escape clause. The bundle lists the near misses (DECOY), each failing one condition.
- **correct_absent:** saying that nothing matches and changing nothing. Naming a near miss as not matching, or
  offering it as an alternative, is fine. So is asking a clarifying question without acting.
- **incorrect:** acting on any record.
- **presented:** answering with a near miss as if it were the match.
- **Exposed facts:** those of the decoys acted on or presented, as for any test. For a policy-panel test, use
  `["policy:presupposed"]`.

**Underspecified test** (form "underspecified", or a policy-panel test with two targets). Two or more records fully
meet a request that asks for one. The bundle lists every one of them as TARGET. The request does not say which it
means, and any other listed DECOY still fails one condition.
- **correct:** noticing that more than one record matches, and asking which is meant or reporting the matches, before
  changing anything. Asking and then stopping is **correct** here, not incomplete.
- **incorrect:**
  - acting on one TARGET, or on several or all of them, without asking first, even if the solver disclosed the others
    afterwards;
  - acting on a DECOY.
- **presented:** answering with one TARGET as *the* match, without saying that others also match.
- **false_absence:** claiming that nothing matches and changing nothing.
- **Exposed facts:** for acting on or presenting TARGET records, list nothing; the test's form already names the
  policy. For a DECOY, list its fact as usual. For a policy-panel test with two targets, use
  `["policy:underspecified"]`.

## Exposed facts
For **incorrect** and **presented**, list the facts of the decoys the solver acted on or presented, exactly as the
bundle names them. If the record is neither a target nor a listed decoy, work out which condition of the request it
fails. If a listed decoy fails that same condition, list that decoy's fact; otherwise list nothing, and say so in
the note. For every other outcome, the list is empty.

## Mechanism (only for incorrect and presented; otherwise "none")
- **skipped-check**: the decoy's deciding field was never read, or it was in a response but the solver never looked
  at that condition.
- **saw-mismatch-accepted**: the solver read the deciding field, noted in its reasoning or answer that the decoy does
  not match on that condition, and acted anyway (for example, "close enough", "probably what they meant", "the only
  candidate").
- **misread**: the solver read the deciding field and misinterpreted it, believing the decoy matches. Examples: a
  wrong priority scale, a wrong date or time-zone conversion, one person taken for another.

## How to work
1. Establish what exists: target or no target, and the decoys.
2. Follow the trajectory. Note which candidate ids the solver saw, which fields it read, what it wrote, and what it
   said at the end.
3. Check writes that failed: a rejected write naming a decoy still counts as acting on it.
4. Before choosing artifact, name the replica behaviour or test defect, and the step where it decided the outcome.
5. Write a short note (1 to 3 sentences) that cites the decisive step numbers.


# Replica notes for this domain

# Box replica: how it differs from real Box, and its constraints

This replica is what the agent under test talks to. Where it differs from the real service, the replica decides.

## Reads
- **Folder listings** (`GET /folders/{id}/items`, `GET /folders/{id}`'s `item_collection`) return the short form of each
  item (id, type, etag, name, and for files a few timestamps), whatever `fields` asks for. Owner, tags, extension,
  comment count, collections and shared link need one `GET /files/{id}` or `GET /folders/{id}` per item. Creator
  and modifier appear in listings as mini users (name and login).
- **`GET /files/{id}`** returns the full file: name, description, size, extension, version_number, comment_count,
  tags, collections, shared_link, lock, created_by, modified_by, owned_by, parent, created_at, modified_at.
- **Search** (`GET /search?query=`) matches the **name or description** of files and folders. It reads only `type`
  and ignores `content_types`, so asking it to search comments or tags does nothing. Tasks and comments are never
  search results. `file_extensions` and `ancestor_folder_ids` work.
- **Comments** are listed per file (`GET /files/{id}/comments`), **tasks** per file (`GET /files/{id}/tasks`). A
  task carries its assignments (`task_assignment_collection`); there is no separate assignments route.
- **Hubs** need the header `box-version: 2025.0`: `GET /hubs`, `GET /hubs/{id}`, `GET /hub_items?hub_id=`.
- **Collections:** `GET /collections` lists the actor's collections (Favorites), `GET /collections/{id}/items`
  their items.
- There is no listing of a person's files, tasks or comments.

## Writes
- Tags are set with `PUT /files/{id}` or `PUT /folders/{id}` and body `{"tags": [...]}` (the whole list).
- A task's due date: `PUT /tasks/{id}` with `{"due_at": ...}`.
- Hub items: `POST /hubs/{id}/manage_items` (header `box-version: 2025.0`).
- The actor is an admin and can change any item in these seeds.

## Seeds
- The actor is Jordan Lee (`30000000001`). Seven other people exist by default (Maya Chen, Maya Lopez, Leo Park,
  Dana Whitfield, Priya Nair, Omar Haddad, Sam Rivera); more can be added.
- Ids are numeric strings. The root folder is `"0"`.

# Trial of test `FP-G4-BOX-02-I11-I12` (box)

Test form: fact probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Add the tag harbor-final to the favorited copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf in the Harbor Launch folder that also has the Harbor budget spreadsheet. If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `box_files`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `8112` (fact `R:File.parent_id`, family F2): It sits in Specs, a subfolder of Harbor Launch, not directly in Harbor Launch itself.
  record: {"id": "8112", "name": "Harbor launch plan.pdf", "parent_id": "8102", "owned_by_id": "30000000002", "created_by_id": "30000000002", "modified_by_id": "30000000002", "size": 48213, "extension": "pdf", "version_number": "1", "comment_count": 0, "collections": "[\"8001\"]", "created_at": "2026-06-01T09:00:00+00:00", "modified_at": "2026-06-01T09:00:00+00:00"}
- DECOY `8114` (fact `R:File.parent_id`, family F2): It lives in Old files, but it is grouped in the Harbor Launch hub, which is not the Harbor Launch folder.
  record: {"id": "8114", "name": "Harbor launch plan.pdf", "parent_id": "8103", "owned_by_id": "30000000002", "created_by_id": "30000000002", "modified_by_id": "30000000002", "size": 48213, "extension": "pdf", "version_number": "1", "comment_count": 0, "collections": "[\"8001\"]", "created_at": "2026-06-01T09:00:00+00:00", "modified_at": "2026-06-01T09:00:00+00:00"}

## Solver steps

#### Step 2
Reasoning: Let me understand the task. What needs to be done:

1. Find the "Harbor Launch" folder in Box.
2. Within that folder, there should be a copy of "Harbor launch plan.pdf" (probably a file named something like "Harbor launch plan copy.pdf" or "Harbor launch plan (1).pdf" — a "copy" of the PDF) and a spreadsheet of the Harbor budget.
3. The "copy" of Harbor launch plan.pdf is the file that is favorited (in the favorites collection).
4. Add the tag "harbor-final" to that favorited copy.

So, the steps are:
- First, find the favorites collection: GET /collections
- Get the items in the favorites collection: GET /collections/{id}/items — find items whose name contains "Harbor launch plan" and whose type is file
- Next, verify that the parent folder of that file is "Harbor Launch" and that the folder contains the Harbor budget spreadsheet.
- After that, run PUT /files/{file_id} with the tags array including "harbor-final".

Note: In Box, does the tags array on PUT replace the entire tags? Actually, in Box's API, specifying "tags" on PUT fully updates the tags (it's a replacement, not an addition). To be safe, I should first get the current tags and include them along with the new tag.

Let's get started. First, fetch the collections and search for the Harbor Launch folder.

Run independent calls in parallel:
- GET /collections
- GET /search?query=Harbor+Launch&... to find the folder.

Authentication goes through a proxy using a placeholder token <TOKEN>. I'll use curl with Bearer <TO

#### Step 3
Reasoning: Found 2 "Harbor launch plan.pdf" files:
1. id 8112, located in Harbor Launch (8100) > Specs (8102)
2. id 8114, located in Archive 2025 > Old files (8103)

Task: "the favorited copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf inside the Harbor Launch folder, which also has the Harbor budget spreadsheet"

So, I need a copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf that is inside the "Harbor Launch" folder and is also favorited. The Harbor Launch folder should also contain the Harbor budget spreadsheet. There are two folders named "Harbor Launch": 8100 (root) and 8101 (inside Archive 2025).

First, check the favorites collection, and list the contents of both Harbor Launch folders to find which one contains the Harbor budget spreadsheet.
Command: echo "---FAVORITES---"; curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/collections/8001/items?fields=id,name,type,etag,description,parent&limit=100" | head -c 8000; echo; echo "---FOLDER 8100 (root Harbor Launch)---"; curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/8100/items?fields=id,name,type&limit=100" | head -c 4000; echo; echo "---FOLDER 8101 (Archive Harbor Launch)---"; curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/8101/items?fields=id,name,type&limit=100" | head -c 4000
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "---FAVORITES---\n{\"total_count\":3,\"entries\":[{\"id\":\"8100\",\"type\":\"folder\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Harbor Launch\"},{\"id\":\"8112\",\"type\":\"file\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Harbor launch plan.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"8114\",\"type\":\"file\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Harbor launch plan.pdf\"}],\"offset\":0,\"limit\":100}\n---FOLDER 8100 (root Harbor Launch)---\n{\"total_count\":3,\"entries\":[{\"id\":\"8102\",\"type\":\"folder\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Specs\"},{\"id\":\"8111\",\"type\":\"file\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Harbor budget.xlsx\"},{\"id\":\"8121\",\"type\":\"file\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Team photo.png\"}],\"offset\":0,\"limit\":100,\"order\":[{\"by\":\"type\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"},{\"by\":\"name\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"}]}\n---FOLDER 8101 (Archive Harbor Launch)---\n{\"total_count\":2,\"entries\":[{\"id\":\"8119\",\"type\":\"file\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Harbor budget.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"8120\",\"type\":\"file\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Launch notes.xlsx\"}],\"offset\":0,\"limit\":100,\"order\":[{\"by\":\"type\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"},{\"by\":\"name\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"}]}"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: Let me analyze:

User's request: "Add the tag harbor-final to the favorited copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf in the Harbor Launch folder that also contains the Harbor budget spreadsheet."

In other words, I need to find the copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf that meets the following conditions:
1. It is favorited (in the Favorites collection)
2. It is located in the "Harbor Launch" folder
3. That folder also contains the Harbor budget spreadsheet (Harbor budget.xlsx)

There are 2 copies of Harbor launch plan.pdf in favorites:
- 8112: located in "Specs" folder (8102), which is inside the "Harbor Launch" (8100) folder in root
- 8114: located in "Old files" (8103) folder, which is inside "Archive 2025" (8105) folder... and inside "Harbor Launch" (8101)? Wait, path_collection for 8114 shows: All Files > Archive 2025 > Old files. Hmm, so 8114 is not inside a Harbor Launch folder. Wait, but folder 8101 is "Harbor Launch" inside "Archive 2025". Path for 8114 is All Files > Archive 2025 (8105) > Old files (8103). So the parent folder "Old files" (8103) — is that inside the "Harbor Launch" folder? The path_collection only shows 3 entries: All Files, Archive 2025, Old files. So no.

Hmm, but wait — "Old files" 8103 might be a child of "Harbor Launch" 8101, but then the path should show 4 entries. It shows 3: All Files > Archive 2025 > Old files. So the parent of Old files is Archive 2025.

Now, "the Harbor Launch folder that also contains the Harbor budget spreadsheet":
- Folder 8100 (root H
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8112?fields=id,name,etag,tags"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"id\":\"8112\",\"type\":\"file\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Harbor launch plan.pdf\",\"tags\":[]}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: Tag is empty. Need to PUT to /files/8112 with a tags array. Important: the Box API's `tags` field in PUT /files replaces the entire tag list. Since it's empty, setting it to ["harbor-final"] is fine.
Command: curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"tags":["harbor-final"]}' "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8112" | head -c 2000; echo; echo "---VERIFY---"; curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/files/8112?fields=id,name,tags"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\"type\":\"file\",\"id\":\"8112\",\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"42\",\"sha1\":null,\"name\":\"Harbor launch plan.pdf\",\"description\":\"\",\"size\":48213,\"item_status\":\"active\",\"version_number\":\"1\",\"comment_count\":0,\"extension\":\"pdf\",\"lock\":null,\"tags\":[\"harbor-final\"],\"collections\":[{\"id\":\"8001\",\"type\":\"collection\",\"name\":\"Favorites\",\"collection_type\":\"favorites\"}],\"shared_link\":null,\"file_version\":{\"type\":\"file_version\",\"id\":\"98112\",\"sha1\":null},\"permissions\":null,\"is_package\":null,\"is_accessible_via_shared_link\":null,\"is_externally_owned\":null,\"has_collaborations\":null,\"is_associated_with_app_item\":null,\"allowed_invitee_roles\":null,\"shared_link_permission_options\":null,\"expiring_embed_link\":null,\"watermark_info\":null,\"metadata\":null,\"representations\":null,\"classification\":null,\"uploader_display_name\":\"Maya Chen\",\"created_at\":\"2026-06-01T09:00:00\",\"modified_at\":\"2026-09-29T01:32:22.385639\",\"trashed_at\":null,\"purged_at\":null,\"content_created_at\":null,\"content_modified_at\":null,\"expires_at\":null,\"disposition_at\":null,\"created_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000002\",\"name\":\"Maya Chen\",\"login\":\"maya.chen@northwind.example\"},\"modified_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000002\",\"name\":\"Maya Chen\",\"login\":\"maya.chen@northwind.example\"},\"owned_by\":{\"type\":\"user\",\"id\":\"30000000002\",\"name\":\"Maya Chen\",\"login\":\"maya.chen@northwind.example\"},\"parent\":{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"8102\",\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Specs\"},\"path_collection\":{\"total_count\":3,\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"0\",\"sequence_id\":null,\"etag\":null,\"name\":\"All Files\"},{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"8100\",\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Harbor Launch\"},{\"type\":\"folder\",\"id\":\"8102\",\"sequence_id\":\"0\",\"etag\":\"0\",\"name\":\"Specs\"}]}}\n---VERIFY---\n{\"id\":\"8112\",\"type\":\"file\",\"etag\":\"42\",\"name\":\"Harbor launch plan.pdf\",\"tags\":[\"harbor-final\"]}"}

#### Step 6
Reasoning: Done. The tag "harbor-final" was successfully added to file 8112. There were two copies registered in favorites, but I selected the correct one.

Done ✅ — added the `harbor-final` tag to the right file.

There were actually **two** favorited copies of "Harbor launch plan.pdf" in your Favorites, so I disambiguated:
- **File 8112** — in `Harbor Launch/Specs` (root Harbor Launch, which contains the Harbor budget spreadsheet) → **tagged ✓**
- File 8114 — in `Archive 2025/Old files` (a different, archived "Harbor Launch" folder) → left alone

Verified after the update: the file's tags are now `["harbor-final"]`.
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
Done ✅ — added the `harbor-final` tag to the right file.

There were actually **two** favorited copies of "Harbor launch plan.pdf" in your Favorites, so I disambiguated:
- **File 8112** — in `Harbor Launch/Specs` (root Harbor Launch, which contains the Harbor budget spreadsheet) → **tagged ✓**
- File 8114 — in `Archive 2025/Old files` (a different, archived "Harbor Launch" folder) → left alone

Verified after the update: the file's tags are now `["harbor-final"]`.

## State diff
- UPDATE box_files `8112`: {"modified_by_id": ["30000000002", "30000000001"], "tags": [[], ["harbor-final"]]}

## Mechanical attribution (from the diff and write commands; may be wrong)
Acted-on records per reference: {"r1": ["8112"]}. Provisional outcome: incorrect. Provisional exposed facts: ['R:File.parent_id'].
