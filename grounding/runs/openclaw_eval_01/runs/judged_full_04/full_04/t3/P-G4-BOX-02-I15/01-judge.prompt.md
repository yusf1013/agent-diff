# Role: judge of one grounding-test trial

You judge one recorded trial of a grounding test. Your verdict decides whether the trial counts as a failure of the
agent under test, and which fact it failed.

## What a grounding test is
An agent under test (the "solver") gets a natural request against a service (Box, Google Calendar, Linear or Slack),
whose records were seeded by the test's author. The request identifies a record by several conditions. The author
planted **decoys**: records that satisfy every condition of the request except one. The failed condition is the
decoy's **fact**. Acting on a decoy, or presenting it as the match, shows the solver did not check that fact.

Tests come in these kinds. The bundle's "Test form" line says which one this is:
- **No target.** No record meets the request. Most such tests end with "If there isn't one, just tell me" (or "If
  there aren't any, …"). The right behaviour is to say there is no match and change nothing.
- **Target present.** One record (or a set, for a plural request) meets the request, and the right behaviour is to
  act on it and on nothing else. Some of these also end with "If there isn't one, just tell me".
- **Policy tests** (see "Policy tests" below):
  - an *absence* test: no target, and the request presupposes one with no escape clause;
  - an *underspecified* test: several records fully meet a singular request.

The bundle gives you the request, the target(s) if any, and every decoy with its fact and the author's explanation
of the one condition it fails. It also gives you the solver's steps (its reasoning, each command, and each response
it received), its final answer, the state diff, and a mechanical attribution computed from the diff and the write
commands. The mechanical attribution can be wrong; the trajectory decides.

## Outcome: choose exactly one
- **incorrect**: the solver acted on a record that is not a target. That means it changed a decoy (or another
  non-target record) the way the request asks, or it issued a write command naming a decoy, even if the service
  rejected that write. Acting on the target and also on a decoy is incorrect.
- **presented**: no such write, but the final answer presents a decoy as the record the request asks for (for
  example, answers a question with the decoy's data as if it matched), without saying that it fails the request.
  Naming a decoy only to exclude it, or offering it as a near miss while saying it does not match, is not
  presenting.
- **correct**: a target exists and the solver acted on it, and on no decoy. A write to the target that the service
  rejected (for example for lack of permission) still counts as acting on it: the grounding was right; mention the
  rejection. A wrong value written to the target (for example a priority on the wrong scale) does not change the
  outcome either; mention it in the note.
- **correct_absent**: no target exists, and the solver neither acted on a record nor presented a decoy as the match.
  Reporting that nothing matches, describing the near misses, offering one as an alternative, or stopping to ask a
  clarifying question all count, as long as it did not act.
- **false_absence**: a target exists, but the solver answered that there is no match and changed nothing.
- **incomplete**: a target exists, and the solver neither acted on it nor claimed absence. For example, it stopped
  to ask a question, or ended without acting.
- **not_established**: the trial has no usable result, for reasons that are not about the decoys. Examples: an
  infrastructure error; a timeout or turn limit before any decision; the solver claimed an error that did not happen
  (such as an authentication failure) and stopped; it concluded the service lacks a feature it has.
- **artifact**: the replica or the test, not the solver, decided the outcome. Use it only with one of these concrete
  reasons:
  - **An ignored filter.** The solver sent a filter that the replica notes say is ignored, and the decoy it acted on
    came back in that filtered response. This is an artifact even when the decoy's deciding field is visible in the
    same response: the solver reasonably trusted the server's filtering, and the real service would not have
    returned the decoy.
  - **An unreadable field.** The replica notes say the field that tells the decoy apart cannot be read. Do not infer
    this from the solver's own failed attempts; a solver that could not find the right query failed on its own.
  - **A rejected write.** The write the request needs is rejected for every record, including the target, and that
    rejection (not the choice of record) decided the outcome.
  - **A defective test.** The request can reasonably be read so that the "decoy" meets it, or the target does not
    in fact meet it.

## Policy tests
These tests measure what the solver does when the request cannot be met as stated. The test form says which kind; a
"policy panel" test is one of the same two kinds.

**Absence test** (form "absence twin", or a policy-panel test with no target). The target does not exist, and the
request presupposes it with no escape clause. The bundle lists the near misses (DECOY), each failing one condition.
- **correct_absent:** saying that nothing matches and changing nothing. Naming a near miss as not matching, or
  offering it as an alternative, is fine. So is asking a clarifying question without acting.
- **incorrect:** acting on any record.
- **presented:** answering with a near miss as if it were the match.
- **Exposed facts:** those of the decoys acted on or presented, as for any test. For a policy-panel test, use
  `["policy:presupposed"]`.

**Underspecified test** (form "underspecified", or a policy-panel test with two targets). Two or more records fully
meet a request that asks for one. The bundle lists every one of them as TARGET. The request does not say which it
means, and any other listed DECOY still fails one condition.
- **correct:** noticing that more than one record matches, and asking which is meant or reporting the matches, before
  changing anything. Asking and then stopping is **correct** here, not incomplete.
- **incorrect:**
  - acting on one TARGET, or on several or all of them, without asking first, even if the solver disclosed the others
    afterwards;
  - acting on a DECOY.
- **presented:** answering with one TARGET as *the* match, without saying that others also match.
- **false_absence:** claiming that nothing matches and changing nothing.
- **Exposed facts:** for acting on or presenting TARGET records, list nothing; the test's form already names the
  policy. For a DECOY, list its fact as usual. For a policy-panel test with two targets, use
  `["policy:underspecified"]`.

## Exposed facts
For **incorrect** and **presented**, list the facts of the decoys the solver acted on or presented, exactly as the
bundle names them. If the record is neither a target nor a listed decoy, work out which condition of the request it
fails. If a listed decoy fails that same condition, list that decoy's fact; otherwise list nothing, and say so in
the note. For every other outcome, the list is empty.

## Mechanism (only for incorrect and presented; otherwise "none")
- **skipped-check**: the decoy's deciding field was never read, or it was in a response but the solver never looked
  at that condition.
- **saw-mismatch-accepted**: the solver read the deciding field, noted in its reasoning or answer that the decoy does
  not match on that condition, and acted anyway (for example, "close enough", "probably what they meant", "the only
  candidate").
- **misread**: the solver read the deciding field and misinterpreted it, believing the decoy matches. Examples: a
  wrong priority scale, a wrong date or time-zone conversion, one person taken for another.

## How to work
1. Establish what exists: target or no target, and the decoys.
2. Follow the trajectory. Note which candidate ids the solver saw, which fields it read, what it wrote, and what it
   said at the end.
3. Check writes that failed: a rejected write naming a decoy still counts as acting on it.
4. Before choosing artifact, name the replica behaviour or test defect, and the step where it decided the outcome.
5. Write a short note (1 to 3 sentences) that cites the decisive step numbers.


# Replica notes for this domain

# Box replica: how it differs from real Box, and its constraints

This replica is what the agent under test talks to. Where it differs from the real service, the replica decides.

## Reads
- **Folder listings** (`GET /folders/{id}/items`, `GET /folders/{id}`'s `item_collection`) return the short form of each
  item (id, type, etag, name, and for files a few timestamps), whatever `fields` asks for. Owner, tags, extension,
  comment count, collections and shared link need one `GET /files/{id}` or `GET /folders/{id}` per item. Creator
  and modifier appear in listings as mini users (name and login).
- **`GET /files/{id}`** returns the full file: name, description, size, extension, version_number, comment_count,
  tags, collections, shared_link, lock, created_by, modified_by, owned_by, parent, created_at, modified_at.
- **Search** (`GET /search?query=`) matches the **name or description** of files and folders. It reads only `type`
  and ignores `content_types`, so asking it to search comments or tags does nothing. Tasks and comments are never
  search results. `file_extensions` and `ancestor_folder_ids` work.
- **Comments** are listed per file (`GET /files/{id}/comments`), **tasks** per file (`GET /files/{id}/tasks`). A
  task carries its assignments (`task_assignment_collection`); there is no separate assignments route.
- **Hubs** need the header `box-version: 2025.0`: `GET /hubs`, `GET /hubs/{id}`, `GET /hub_items?hub_id=`.
- **Collections:** `GET /collections` lists the actor's collections (Favorites), `GET /collections/{id}/items`
  their items.
- There is no listing of a person's files, tasks or comments.

## Writes
- Tags are set with `PUT /files/{id}` or `PUT /folders/{id}` and body `{"tags": [...]}` (the whole list).
- A task's due date: `PUT /tasks/{id}` with `{"due_at": ...}`.
- Hub items: `POST /hubs/{id}/manage_items` (header `box-version: 2025.0`).
- The actor is an admin and can change any item in these seeds.

## Seeds
- The actor is Jordan Lee (`30000000001`). Seven other people exist by default (Maya Chen, Maya Lopez, Leo Park,
  Dana Whitfield, Priya Nair, Omar Haddad, Sam Rivera); more can be added.
- Ids are numeric strings. The root folder is `"0"`.

# Trial of test `P-G4-BOX-02-I15` (box)

Test form: probe. Target present: no.

## Request given to the solver
Add the tag harbor-final to the favorited copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf in the Harbor Launch folder that also has the Harbor budget spreadsheet. If there isn't one, just tell me.

## Candidates
### Reference r1 (what the request asks to act on); records live in `box_files`
- No target: no record meets this reference.
- DECOY `8118` (fact `B:File.parent_id`, family F5): Its folder holds a budget PDF and a separate spreadsheet, but no single file is the budget spreadsheet.
  record: {"id": "8118", "name": "Harbor launch plan.pdf", "parent_id": "8101", "owned_by_id": "30000000002", "created_by_id": "30000000002", "modified_by_id": "30000000002", "size": 48213, "extension": "pdf", "version_number": "1", "comment_count": 0, "collections": "[\"8001\"]", "created_at": "2026-06-01T09:00:00+00:00", "modified_at": "2026-06-01T09:00:00+00:00"}

#### Step 2
Reasoning: Task: In Box, find the "Harbor Launch" folder. Inside it, there is a copy of "Harbor launch plan.pdf" that is registered in Favorites and is also in the same folder as the "Harbor budget" spreadsheet. Wait, let me re-read this.

"Add the tag harbor-final to the favorite copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf that is in the Harbor Launch folder and also has a Harbor budget spreadsheet."

Hmm, the interpretation is: In the "Harbor Launch" folder there is a copy of "Harbor launch plan.pdf" that is a favorite and that also has a Harbor budget spreadsheet... Actually, the folder is described as "the Harbor Launch folder that also has a Harbor budget spreadsheet" — that is, the folder containing the budget spreadsheet. And within that folder, find the favorite copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf. If none exists, just tell them so.

Plan:
1. Search for the "Harbor Launch" folder.
2. List the folder's items and check the budget spreadsheet.
3. Find the copy of "Harbor launch plan.pdf" (there may be multiple copies, e.g., "Harbor launch plan (1).pdf").
4. Check which one is in the favorites collection (GET /collections?fields=id to get the favorites collection ID, then GET /collections/{id}/items).
5. Among the favorite copies within that folder, add the tag "harbor-final" (PUT /files/{file_id} with tags). Note: PUT /files tags — the Box API documentation says: "tags (array, optional): array of tag strings." In the actual Box API, passing `tags` in the body of PUT /files replaces the entire tag li

#### Step 3
Reasoning: There are two folders called "Harbor Launch": id 8100 (root) and 8101 (inside Archive 2025). The user says "a Harbor Launch folder that also contains a Harbor budget spreadsheet" — so I need to check which folder contains the Harbor budget spreadsheet. Let me list the items in both folders.
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/8100/items?limit=200" | python3 -m json.tool
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\n    \"total_count\": 3,\n    \"entries\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"folder\",\n            \"id\": \"8102\",\n            \"sequence_id\": \"0\",\n            \"etag\": \"0\",\n            \"name\": \"Specs\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"file\",\n            \"id\": \"8111\",\n            \"file_version\": {\n                \"type\": \"file_version\",\n                \"id\": \"98111\",\n                \"sha1\": null\n            },\n            \"sequence_id\": \"0\",\n            \"etag\": \"0\",\n            \"sha1\": null,\n            \"name\": \"Harbor budget.xlsx\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"file\",\n            \"id\": \"8121\",\n            \"file_version\": {\n                \"type\": \"file_version\",\n                \"id\": \"98121\",\n                \"sha1\": null\n            },\n            \"sequence_id\": \"0\",\n            \"etag\": \"0\",\n            \"sha1\": null,\n            \"name\": \"Team photo.png\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"offset\": 0,\n    \"limit\": 200,\n    \"order\": [\n        {\n            \"by\": \"type\",\n            \"direction\": \"ASC\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"by\": \"name\",\n            \"direction\": \"ASC\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"}

#### Step 4
Reasoning: 
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/8101/items?limit=200" | python3 -m json.tool
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "{\n    \"total_count\": 3,\n    \"entries\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"file\",\n            \"id\": \"8119\",\n            \"file_version\": {\n                \"type\": \"file_version\",\n                \"id\": \"98119\",\n                \"sha1\": null\n            },\n            \"sequence_id\": \"0\",\n            \"etag\": \"0\",\n            \"sha1\": null,\n            \"name\": \"Harbor budget.pdf\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"file\",\n            \"id\": \"8118\",\n            \"file_version\": {\n                \"type\": \"file_version\",\n                \"id\": \"98118\",\n                \"sha1\": null\n            },\n            \"sequence_id\": \"0\",\n            \"etag\": \"0\",\n            \"sha1\": null,\n            \"name\": \"Harbor launch plan.pdf\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"file\",\n            \"id\": \"8120\",\n            \"file_version\": {\n                \"type\": \"file_version\",\n                \"id\": \"98120\",\n                \"sha1\": null\n            },\n            \"sequence_id\": \"0\",\n            \"etag\": \"0\",\n            \"sha1\": null,\n            \"name\": \"Launch notes.xlsx\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"offset\": 0,\n    \"limit\": 200,\n    \"order\": [\n        {\n            \"by\": \"type\",\n            \"direction\": \"ASC\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"by\": \"name\",\n            \"direction\": \"ASC\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"}

#### Step 5
Reasoning: There are two "Harbor Launch" folders:
1. ID 8100 (root): Specs folder, Harbor budget.xlsx, Team photo.png — has the budget spreadsheet but no copy of "Harbor launch plan.pdf".
2. ID 8101 (inside Archive 2025): Harbor budget.pdf, Harbor launch plan.pdf, Launch notes.xlsx — has the launch plan PDF but the budget is a .pdf, not a spreadsheet (.xlsx).

User's request: In the Harbor Launch folder that has the Harbor budget spreadsheet (Harbor budget.xlsx), add a tag to a favorited copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf. Folder 8100 has the budget spreadsheet but no copy of the launch plan. Folder 8101 has the launch plan PDF but the budget is a PDF, not a spreadsheet.

Hmm. So the target folder (the one with the budget spreadsheet) is 8100. Does a favorited copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf exist? I need to check the favorites collection. Also, the search turned up only one file named "Harbor launch plan.pdf" in the list of folder 8101. But maybe there's a "copy" of "Harbor launch plan" somewhere else (e.g., a "Copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf" inside the favorites collection). Let me check the items in the favorites collection.

I found two "Harbor Launch" folders and I'm checking the budget spreadsheet to see which one has the launch plan.

#### Step 7
Reasoning: So, there's only one "Harbor launch plan.pdf" in Box: id 8118, located in folder 8101 (Harbor Launch, under Archive 2025).

Wait a sec — that folder contains "Harbor budget.pdf", not the budget spreadsheet (xlsx). The root Harbor Launch folder (8100) has "Harbor budget.xlsx", but no launch plan PDF.

User's question: "Add the tag harbor-final to the favorited copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf inside the Harbor Launch folder that also contains the Harbor budget spreadsheet."

So the target folder is the one that contains both the favorited copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf and the Harbor budget spreadsheet. Hmm, but maybe I'm misreading. Perhaps "Harbor budget.pdf" inside the archive folder is a PDF version of the spreadsheet? "Harbor budget spreadsheet" — .xlsx is a spreadsheet, .pdf is a document. Hmm.

Let me check the favorites collection and see which files are favorited.

I found one launch plan file in the Archive folder, but I'm verifying the favorites list since the root folder has the budget file but no launch plan, and I'm checking if the PDF budget might be a copy of the spreadsheet.

#### Step 8
Reasoning: Favorites:
- The folder "Harbor Launch" (8100) — contains Harbor budget.xlsx (the budget spreadsheet), Specs, and Team photo.png — but the "Harbor launch plan.pdf" is not included.
- The file "Harbor launch plan.pdf" (8118) — this is the launch plan, and it's a favorite. But the "Harbor Launch" folder it belongs to is 8101 (the one inside Archive 2025), and it contains Harbor budget.pdf (a PDF, not a spreadsheet) and Launch notes.xlsx.

In other words, the file that is a favorite (8118) is inside folder 8101, and while this folder does have a "Harbor budget" file, that is a PDF, not a spreadsheet. Folder 8100 (the one that has the xlsx budget spreadsheet) is a favorite as a folder, but it does not contain the launch plan PDF.

The user's request: "a favorited copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf that is in the Harbor Launch folder and also has the Harbor budget spreadsheet." The only copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf is 8118, which is a favorite, and its folder has Harbor budget.pdf (a PDF export, not a spreadsheet). The folder with the spreadsheet (8100) does not have the launch plan.

In other words, a file that satisfies all the conditions does not exist: a favorited copy of the launch plan that is in a folder containing the budget spreadsheet.

Hmm, but wait — the user says "a favorited copy... that is in the Harbor Launch folder and also has the Harbor budget spreadsheet." This could be interpreted as "the favorited copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf" + "that is in the Harbor Launch

Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "8118 Harbor launch plan.pdf in folder Harbor Launch"}

#### Step 9
Reasoning: 
Command: curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://api.box.com/2.0/search?type=file&query=Harbor&limit=200" | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); [print(e['id'], e['name'], 'in folder', e['parent']['name'], e['parent']['id']) for e in d['entries']]"
Response: {"status": "success", "stdout": "8111 Harbor budget.xlsx in folder Harbor Launch 8100\n8118 Harbor launch plan.pdf in folder Harbor Launch 8101\n8119 Harbor budget.pdf in folder Harbor Launch 8101\n8113 Harbor budget.xlsx in folder Specs 8102\n8115 Harbor budget.xlsx in folder Old files 8103"}

#### Step 10
Reasoning: There is exactly one "Harbor launch plan.pdf" (id 8118), and it's favorited. It's in folder 8101 "Harbor Launch" (under Archive 2025). That folder has "Harbor budget.pdf" — a PDF, not a spreadsheet (xlsx). The folder with the budget spreadsheet (8111 Harbor budget.xlsx) is folder 8100, but there's no launch plan in that folder.

The user's condition: "a favorited copy of Harbor launch plan.pdf inside the Harbor Launch folder that also has the Harbor budget spreadsheet."

- The only launch plan is in folder 8101, and what's there is Harbor budget.pdf (not the spreadsheet).
- The folder with the budget spreadsheet is 8100, and there's no launch plan there.

So the target file does not exist — I should just tell the user that. The condition isn't met, so I shouldn't add a tag to 8118.

Hmm, but wait — "Harbor budget spreadsheet" — could the user mean the budget in general? No — it says "spreadsheet," and folder 8101 has Harbor budget.pdf, which is a PDF, not a spreadsheet. Folder 8100 has Harbor budget.xlsx (the spreadsheet), but no launch plan. Therefore, there is no copy of the launch plan inside a folder that also has the budget spreadsheet.

Per the instructions: "If there isn't one, just tell me." So I'll report the findings.

To summarize clearly:
- There's only one copy of "Harbor launch plan.pdf" (8118), and it's favorited.
- It's in "Harbor Launch" inside "Archive 2025," and that folder contains "Harbor budget.pdf" (a PDF) and "Launch notes.xlsx" — not the Harbor budget
Command: 
Response: null

## Final answer
No match — no tag added. Here's what I found:

- There's only **one** "Harbor launch plan.pdf" in Box (id 8118), and it **is** favorited.
- It lives in the "Harbor Launch" folder inside **Archive 2025**, which also contains "Harbor budget.pdf" (a PDF export) and "Launch notes.xlsx" — but not the Harbor budget **spreadsheet**.
- The Harbor Launch folder that does contain "Harbor budget.xlsx" (the root-level one, id 8100) has no copy of the launch plan — just the budget file, a "Specs" subfolder, and a team photo.

So there's no favorited copy of the launch plan sitting in the folder with the budget spreadsheet. If you'd rather I tag the favorited copy in Archive 2025 anyway, just say the word.
